            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y very good Lord, this Hiſtorie doth rightly belong vnto you, and you may challenge it as your due for many reaſons. Firſt becauſe the moſt populous Churches of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> are within the circuite and encloſure of your gouernment, &amp; they haue had no time to breath in with libertie, but onely then, when about ſome fortie yeares ſince you defended them from the outrages of their enemies both within and without the Realme: God chearing them vp by his goodneſſe, they haue had a ſure protection by your loue and fauour, and a ſtrong bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke vnder your name. Beſides the proofes of the ſufferings of their forefathers in paſſed ages, are the holy booties and ſpoyles that were made in the taking of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun,</hi> when you reduced that City to the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the King. The Archbiſhops of that place haue carefully kept for aboue theſe laſt 4. hundred yeares, the proceſſe and proceedings againſt the ſaid <hi>Walde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſian</hi> Churches, which hath brought vpon thoſe that perſecuted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

            <p>It was the Lord of <hi>Vulçon</hi> Counſeller to the King in the Court of Parliament at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> that recoured them and brought them to our hands, contenting himſelfe in all that conqueſt with that onely bagge, which inditeth the diuell himſelfe with all his adherents, being reſerued for the good and edification of the Church of God. All which being well conſidered, this benefit comes from you (my Lord) and the fruite of your armes.</p>
            <p>Hauing therefore reſolued with my ſelfe, to bring this hiſtorie to light vnder your name, I haue but brought it to it firſt originall, by reſtoring it to it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor, and dedicating this edifice to him that hath furniſhed it with the moſt ſubſtantiall matter. And herein I haue wrought the more certaintie vnto it, in that I haue dedicated it to him that hath ſeene and knowne more of the ſtate of the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes</hi> then I can write. And herein eſpecially doth the worke of God ſhew it ſelfe, when men of one and the ſame name, and one and the ſame Prouince, haue bene ſo different in their deſignes.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Church of God in the world, is of higher eſteeme then the world it ſelfe. It is the fruition of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. He was crucified for it, and without it nothing can be accounted good. But as our Redeemer inuiteth vs to enter and to continue therein for our ſaluation, ſo Satan endeuoureth to make men wander from the right way to their damnation. He blindeth them, to the end they may take that for the Church that hath but the name thereof, holding them in error, ſeducing them by a worldly glorious pompe, and ſo makes them diſdaine the true Church, principally becauſe it is ſubiect to perſecution in the world: wherein they that honour not the Maiſter cannot che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the ſeruants: in ſuch ſort, that not acknowledging any other Church, then that which hath triumphed, for many ages together, in the bloud of thoſe Martyrs whom it hath killed, they demand with great importunitie, what, and in what parts of the world the Chatholicke Church hath bene, if that which ſo long and ſo peaceably hath obtained the title thereof be not the ſame? Where was it hid (ſay they) during the fiue ages laſt paſt? They are inſtant vpon vs, that at the least we ſhew them ſome one, in the whole courſe of ſo many yeares, that hath beleeued that, which in our times hath bene ſo much extolled vnder the name of Reformation.</p>
            <p>This hiſtorie of the Chriſtians called Waldenſes &amp; Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes will ſatisfie thoſe that can reade it without paſſion. For therein appeares, that for theſe laſt foure hundred and fiftie yeares, there haue bene (eſpecially in Europe) a great number, in diuers kingdomes and countries, which haue made profeſſion of a religion altogether conformable to the word of God, and the doctrine which hath bene receiued in the reformed Churches; hauing mourned vnder the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb facs="tcp:173840:6"/>of Antechrist, wherein they ſhined like precious ſtones in a dunghill, and roſes among the thornes. They ſeemed to the world but as abiect men, but God beheld them as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and gaue them eyes to ſee, and eares to heare, and an heart to vnderſtand the truth. And as he made way to his iudgements, by leauing thoſe to the ſpirit of amazedneſſe that had forſaken his word: ſo he hath made way to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in withdrawing this remainder of his people from the Temples polluted with idolatries, cauſing the ſacred inward miniſterie of his Spirit to worke in them, prouiding them temples, and preſeruing them from the infection of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall miniſterie, defiled with infinite humane inuentions.</p>
            <p>The writings of the ſaid Waldenſes and Albingenſes, which haue bene miraculouſly preſerued vnto this preſent time, make good in this hiſtorie the puritie of their religion, and iuſtifie them against the imputations of their aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. They make it appeare vnto the world, that they haue had for the foundation of their faith, the Simbole of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, allowing alſo of that of Athanaſius: for the rule of their obedience, the eternall law of God: for the ſubſtance of their prayers, the Lords prayer. And finally that they haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the Sacraments inſtituted by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in the ſelfe ſame puritie wherein he firſt ordained them. And alſo that they haue alwayes liued vnder a good and holy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, carrying themſelues in regard of their manners and conuerſation according to the ſame word, which is the rule of their faith. And yet neuertheleſſe we ſhall make it appeare, that for all theſe things, without which no man can be a true Chriſtian, they haue bene cruelly condemned to death, bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, ſacked, burnt, curſed, and perſecuted with violence of armes.</p>
            <p>Without reaſon then is it demanded, where the Church was in theſe ages laſt paſt, ſince it appeares that the almoſt
<pb facs="tcp:173840:6"/>infinite numbers which the Popes for righteouſneſſe ſake haue put to death, were the Church, how contrarie ſoeuer to the Church of Rome and the Popes, in whatſoeuer they were contrary to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as the firſt point of the truth which theſe faithfull Martyrs haue maintained, concerneth God, who is without beginning and without end, without whoſe command there is nothing true or auailable, it muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily follow that the inuentions of men must giue place when God ſpeaketh, eſpecially the truth being as ancient as the lye. And we muſt alſo acknowledge, that they that haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in former ages in one onely God by Ieſus Chriſt, haue bene the true members of the Church, making the Catholike Church, in what part of the world ſoeuer they haue bene pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Now it appeares by the doctrine and confeſſion of the faithfull (whereof much is ſpoken in this hiſtorie) that they haue alwayes put their hope in the liuing God, expecting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and life by no other meanes but by the Sonne of God. If then for theſe things they haue bene ſlaughtered, what wrong is done vnto thoſe that are guiltie of the ſame ſinnes, by thoſe bloudie deſires which they haue to baniſh thoſe out of the world whoſe mouthes by reaſon they cannot ſtop, if ſeeming to ſeeke the Church in ages paſt, they be ſent vnto thoſe faithfull whom ſuch as themſelues haue put to death. Haue they not rather reaſon to be thankfull vnto God with vs, for that the violent aſſaults of Satan haue bene alwayes in vaine, becauſe the Church hath euer continued in the perſon of Gods ſeruants victorious by faith, and triumphant by martyrdome: which we haue not meaſured in this hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie according to the crueltie of their puniſhment, but the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and goodneſſe of the cauſe? It will adde much to the glory of God, to follow this bloud by the trace, gathering together the certaine proofes of the faith and conſtancie of millions of
<pb facs="tcp:173840:7"/>witneſſes, who haue ſealed the truth with the loſſe of their owne liues. They whoſe hearts God ſhall moue to enlarge this hiſtorie, by the true narration of what hath paſſed touching this ſubiect, in thoſe places where it hath pleaſed the Lord to make them grow &amp; increaſe (as there is no Kingdome, State, Principalitie, nor almoſt Citie, towne, or village in Europe, where this innocent bloud hath not bene ſhed) ſhall adde much to the edification of his Church, when many ſhall contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the notice thereof that which God hath done in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ages, that we may know where and how he hath preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it.</p>
            <p>In this holy employment, we need not doubt of the venome of wicked tongues, the ſcoffes of Atheiſts and profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. A ſtomacke ill affected loues nothing but what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto it, and the wicked haue nothing in eſteeme, but what is conformable to their vitious humour. If the quippes of the wicked ſhould haue bene an hinderance to the ſeruice we owe vnto God and to his Church, we had giuen ouer this hiſtorie before we had written three lines thereof: for it hath bene ſnarled at by diuers vpon the firſt bruit thereof, what then may we thinke they will do, when they ſhall ſee that they neuer thought we could ſo truly haue maintained. Doubtleſſe paſſion will extort from malignant mindes the ſuggeſtions of the malignant, in counterchange whereof (hauing aduertiſed thee, gentle Reader, that in the firſt page and inſcription of this hiſtorie, thou haſt the name, the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the intention, the fruite, and the end, in a few lines) I will pray to the eternall God for thoſe that wrong vs, that he would be pleaſed to make them know the truth, and giue vnto vs whom he hath placed and planted in his houſe, after the conflicts of this life, that portion which he hath reſerned in heauen by his welbeloued Sonne our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to whom be all honour glory, and power for euer and euer. Amen.</p>

                  <p>How true this is, it may appeare in that God hauing kept and preſerued vs for aboue theſe forty yeares paſt,

                     <note place="margin">It appeareth by the proces that we haue in our hands by which it appeares that <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. of that name, condemned the vſurpers of the goods of the Waldenſes to a reſtitution.

                  <p>The time and place of thoſe that are to be baptized is not ordained, but the charitie and edification of the Church and congregation muſt ſerue for a rule therein, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they to whom the children were neareſt allied brought their infants to be baptized, as their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or any other whom God had made charitable in that kind.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that being conſtrained for ſome certaine hundred yeares to ſuffer their children to be baptized by the Prieſts of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they deferred the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof as long as they could poſſibly, becauſe they had in deteſtation thoſe humane inuentions which were added to that holy Sacrament, which they held to be but pollutions therof. And foraſmuch as their Paſtors (which they called Barbes) were many times abroad imployed in the ſeruice of their Churches, they could not haue the Sacrament of Baptiſme adminiſtred to their infants by their owne Miniſters: for this cauſe they kept them long from Baptiſme, which the Prieſts perceiuing, and taking notice of, charged them thereupon with this impoſture: which not onely their aduerſaries haue beleeued, but diuerſe others who haue well approued of their life and faith in all other points.</p>
                  <p>The fifth calumnie was, that they adored their Paſtors, proſtrating themſelues before them. To iuſtifie the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> from this impoſture, there needs no more, but that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173840:16"/>the Reader will be pleaſed to take the paines to reade that which they haue written touching the adoration of one onely God, in the expoſition that they made in the booke of their doctrine vpon the firſt Commandement of the Law of God. There you ſhall find that they haue giuen much honour euen to their Paſtors, as vnto thoſe that keepe the word of Reconciliation, entertaining them charitably, accompting themſelues obliged thereunto for conſcience ſake; but that they euer had any intention to giue that worſhip to the creature that is onely due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Creator, can neuer be made good but by way of calumnie.<note place="margin">It appeareth by the proceſſe formed by the ſaid <hi>Albert</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes of the Alpes.</note> Howſoeuer <hi>Albert de Capitaneis</hi> their deadly enemie in the Dioceſſe of <hi>Turin,</hi> would haue extorted from them, that they adored their Paſtors, which he could neuer enforce them to confeſſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt calumnie was, that they maintained, that it was not lawfull to ſweare at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">In their booke intituled the Spirituall Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacke, in the expoſition of the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note>They ſay and affirme, that there are lawfull oathes ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the honour of God and the edification of our neighbours, alledging that place in the 6.

                  <p>The ſeuenth calumnie was, to make them odious to the people, as if they had preferred the peace with the Turke, before that with the Church &amp; the kingdome of Chriſt, affirming that they maintained, that the Pope did mortally ſinne when he ſends an expedition of ſouldiers with the badge of the croſſe vpon their Caſſockes or Coatarmour againſt the <hi>Sarazens.</hi>

In the booke of the cauſes of their ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of Rome. p. 125</note> that ſetteth downe the complaint that then was made, that is to ſay, that the tenths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for the ſuccour of the holy Land, were taken away and conuerted to the reliefe of <hi>Pouille,</hi> againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>The eight calumnie was, that they vſed no reuerence towards holy and conſecrated places, holding that that man ſinned not more grieuouſly that burneth a Church, then he that breakes into any other houſe.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, that neither the place, nor the chaire, make a man the more holy, and they haue maintained that they deceiue themſelues much that comfort themſelues, or preſume the more, becauſe of the dignitie of the place: for what place more high then Paradiſe? what place more ſecure then heauen? and yet neuertheleſſe man was baniſhed out of Paradiſe for ſinning there; and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels were throwne from heauen, to the end they might be examples to thoſe that came after, and to teach them, that it is not the place, nor the greatneſſe nor dignitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that makes a man holy, but the innocencie of his life.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the ninth calumnie, that is to ſay, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that the Magiſtrate ought not to condemne any to death, they ſay:</p>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:173840:17"/>knowledge of the cauſe, then the ſimple report of Prieſts and Monkes, who were parties and iudges, inſomuch that hauing diſcouered the abuſe which they brought into the Church, they condemned them for heretickes, and deliuered them to the ſecular power (ſo they call their Magiſtrates.) Now this ſeemed vnto them a cruell ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie in the ſaid Magiſtrates, to giue faith to perſons paſſionate and not indifferent, ſuch as the aforeſaid Prieſts were, and to put to death ſo many poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent people, neuer hearing them or examining the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The tenth calumnie, was to make them odious to Kings and Princes, that is to ſay, that a lay man in the ſtate of grace, had greater authoritie then a Prince liuing in his ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Againſt this impoſture they affirme,<note place="margin">In the booke of the cauſes of their ſeparation fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Church of Rome. p. 41.</note> that euery one muſt be ſubiect to thoſe that are in authoritie, obey them, loue them, be at peace with them, honour them with double honour, in ſubiection, and obedience, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, paying vnto them that which is their due.</p>
                  <p>The eleuenth calumnie was grounded vpon that aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that the Pope had no authoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Kings and Princes of the earth, who depend im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly vpon God alone.

                  </p>

                  <p>The twelfth calumnie imports thus much, that they held that whatſoeuer is done with a good intention is good, and that euery one ſhall be ſaued in whatſoeuer is done with the ſaid good intention.</p>
                  <p>To this impoſture we need no other anſwer then that which the Monke <hi>Raynerius</hi> (who was alwaies their back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend) ſaith elſewhere,<note place="margin">Rain. lib. de for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma haeretic. art. <hi>38.</hi>
                     </note> that is, that they maintaine that euery man is ſaued by his faith, which he cals a Sect. It is very neceſſary that a lyer ſhould haue a better memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then to affirme things contradictorie.</p>
                  <p>And to ſhew that they made no profeſſion of any ſuch beleefe, that may ſuffice that they haue ſaid againſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; That he hath brought theſe errors into the Church vnder a colour of good intention, and a ſhew of faith.</p>
                  <p>The thirteenth calumnie was, that they maintaine that a man may kill, or detaine from the Prieſts their tithes, without ſcruple of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>It is certaine that if the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> had power to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their tithes to ſome other vſe then to the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe whom they find to be dumbe dogs, drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie watchmen, ſlow bellies, ſeducing and being ſeduced, they had done it:<note place="margin">It appeareth by the proceſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes of Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné, by <hi>Albert de Capitaneis,</hi> &amp; other Monkes Inquiſitors.</note> but there was neuer any as yet that hath occaſioned the leaſt troubles that may be in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.

When his diſciples ſaid vnto him, in the ninth of S. <hi>Luke, Wilt thou that we command that fire come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and conſume them?</hi> Chriſt anſwered and ſaid, <hi>Ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of.</hi> Againe the Lord ſaith vnto <hi>Peter, Put vp thy ſword into thy ſheath, &amp;c.</hi> For temporall aduerſities are to be contemned, and patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be endured, for there happeneth nothing therein that is new. We are here the Lords floore, to be beaten, as the corne when it is ſeparated from the chaffe.</p>
                  <p>The laſt calumnie of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> which we haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the writings of their aduerſaries, is that which <hi>Claud. Rubis</hi> layes vpon them as a foule aſperſion,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And he is not content to tie himſelfe to the <hi>Vaudois</hi> onely, but he addeth, Theſe are things that ordinarily follow one another, Hereſie and Sorcerie, as it is verified (ſaith he) in our times in thoſe Cities and Prouinces that haue giuen entertainment vnto hereſie.</p>
                  <p>We will firſt iuſtifie the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and then anſwer <hi>Rubis</hi> in the behalfe of thoſe Cities and Prouinces which he hath incloſed within this calumnie. All they offend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the firſt Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (ſay the <hi>Vaudois</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the firſt Commandement) that beleeue that the Planets can enforce the will of man. Theſe kind of men, as much as in them lies, accompt the Planets as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:173840:19"/>gods; for they attribute vnto the creature, that which belongs vnto the Creator. Againſt which the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remie</hi> 10. ſpeaketh: <hi>Learne not the way of the heathen, and be not diſmayed at the ſignes of heauen, for the heathen are diſmayed at them.</hi> And S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fourth to the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, <hi>Ye obſerue moneths, and dayes, and times, and yeares: but I am afraid of you, leſt I haue beſtowed vpon you labour in vaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All they offend againſt this commandement, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue Sorcerers and Soothſayers: for theſe men beleeue the diuels are gods. The reaſon is, becauſe they aske of diuels that which God alone can giue, that is, to manifeſt things hidden, and to foreſhew the truth of things to come, which is forbidden of God, Leuit. 19.31. <hi>Regard not them that haue familiar ſpirits, neither ſeeke after wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards to be defiled with them.</hi> And in the 20.6. <hi>The ſoule that turneth after ſuch as haue familiar ſpirits, and after wizards to go a whoring after them, I will ſet my face againſt that ſoule, and will cut him off from amongſt his people.</hi> And in the laſt verſe of that Chapter, <hi>A man or woman that hath a familiar ſpirit, or that is a wizard, ſhall ſurely be put to death; they ſhall ſtone them with ſtones, their bloud ſhall be vpon them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the puniſhment of this ſinne, and the vengeance that God taketh vpon ſuch a one, we reade in the 2. Kings 1.3. that the Angell of the Lord ſent vnto <hi>Elijah</hi> to meete the meſſengers of <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and to ſay vnto them, <hi>Is it not becauſe there is not a God in Iſrael, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the God of Ekron?</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Lord in that place, <hi>Thou ſhalt not come downe from that bed on which thou art gone vp, but ſhalt ſurely die. Saul</hi> died, becauſe he had diſobeyed the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God which he gaue vnto him: he regarded it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:173840:19"/>not, neither did he hope in the Lord, but tooke counſell of Sorcerers, for which cauſe the Lord tooke away his life, and transferred his kingdome vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iſhai.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let euery man therefore know, that all enchantment, or coniuration, or charme in writing, made to giue reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to any kind of perſons or beaſts, is of no value, but is rather a ſnare of our ancient aduerſarie the diuell, by which he entrappeth and deceiueth mankind.</p>
                  <p>Here you may ſee what the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> haue written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sorcerers out of the word of God. It remaineth that we anſwer vnto that calumnie of <hi>Rubis,</hi> that it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in our times, that hereſie and ſorcerie are inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ioyned together, in thoſe Cities and Prouinces that haue giuen place vnto hereſie.</p>
                  <p>He taxeth without all doubt the Citie of <hi>Geneua,</hi> and the States of the <hi>Cantons</hi> that haue receiued the Goſpell, without any other ſhew of proofe, but that moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in thoſe places Sorcerers are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned to death, following the commandement of God, which ſuffereth no Sorcerer to liue. He might farre better haue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if he had ſaid that in thoſe places where the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion was eſtabliſhed in our times, no man doth either conuerſe or hath acquaintance with Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but ſo ſoone as any ſuch is found he is put to death: And therefore no man can affirme that to be true, except he will ſay, that to burne Sorcerers, is to ſupport them, and by the authoritie of the word to put them to death, be a kind of hereſie.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed that in thoſe places hereſie and ſorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie are ioyned together, where they that make profeſſion to teach the people are for the moſt part Sorcerers; whereof many men haue complained, who haue written
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173840:20"/>with a great deale of griefe, that which they knew to be put in practiſe by their Prieſts and Monks, yea by ſome of the Popes themſelues.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:173840:20"/>it is a great wickedneſſe to haue the leaſt ill thought or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of them, ſince they ſhould ſerue for an example to their flocke, and conſidering they are Doctors and teachers; But perhaps (ſaith he) theſe Magicians thinke that this art belongs vnto them by a ſpeciall prerogatiue, and that they haue right thereunto by an hereditarie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, becauſe the Prieſts of Egypt (of whom <hi>Pithago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Empedocles, Democritus, Plato,</hi> haue learned their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke) were Negromancers.

Such were all theſe Popes, as it is ſet downe in their liues, where you may alſo reade many execrable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, whereby they wonne women to their loue, and were much giuen to offer abhominable ſacrifices vnto diuels in forreſts and mountaines.</p>

                  <p>The Magicians then of our times, ſaith <hi>Vuier,</hi> muſt not thinke to couer themſelues vnder this mantell and pretence.

As alſo of that vſe they make of their holy water, of their exorciſed ſalt, their conſecrated tapers at Eaſter, their candles and tapers at Candlemas againſt the diuell, with which he mockes them: as alſo the fumigations of holy bowes vpon Palmeſunday, and of herbes ſtuck vpon the doores vpon the day of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and the ſprinkling of holy water at the feaſt of the Aſſumption of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> Moreouer ſuch Prieſts, ſaith he, abuſe the ſacrament of the Euchariſt to commit their villanies.</p>

                  <p>Moreouer he ſaith, that the Prieſts haue very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently made vſe of diuerſe apparitions of Sathan, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming themſelues to be the ſoules of this or that man, and faining to be in the paines of Purgatory, for their owne particular profit.

                  <p>The famous Parliaments of <hi>Aix</hi> &amp; <hi>Grenoble</hi> haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned vnto death diuerſe Prieſts that were ſorcerers, as namely, at <hi>Aix</hi> a certaine Hermit adored of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a Saint.

                  <p>That the marriage of Prieſts is good and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>That they that heare the word of God, and haue the true knowledge thereof, are the true Church, vnto which Chriſt Ieſus hath deliuered the keyes, to let in the flocke, and to chaſe away the wolues.</p>

                  <p>They are to learne certaine leſſons, and to learne by heart all the Chapters of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and all the Epiſtles which they call Canonicall, a good part of the writings of <hi>Salomon, Dauid</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards hauing good teſtimonies of their learning and conuerſation, they are receiued with the impoſition of hands into the office or function of preaching.</p>
                  <p>The laſt that are receiued are to do nothing without the leaue and licence of their Seniours receiued before them.

                  <p>The money that is giuen vs by the people, is carried to the aforeſaid generall Councell, and is deliuered in the preſence of all, and there it is receiued by the moſt ancients, and part thereof is giuen to thoſe that are tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers or wayfaring men, according to their neceſſities, and part vnto the poore.</p>
                  <p>When any of vs that are Paſtors ſhall fall into anie foule or vncleane ſinne, he is caſt out of our companie, and forbidden the charge of preaching.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt other power and authoritie which God hath giuen to his ſeruants, it belongs vnto them to chuſe guides of the people, and Ancients in their charges, according to the diuerſitie of imployment, in the vnitie of Chriſt.

Let me therefore intreate you by the loue of God, that you decreaſe not, but rather increaſe that charitie, feare and obedience which is due vnto God, and to your ſelues amongſt your ſelues, and keepe all thoſe good cuſtomes which you haue heard and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of God, by our meanes: and that you would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173840:36"/>from amongſt you all defaults and wants, troubling the peace, the loue, the concord, and whatſoeuer taketh from you the ſeruice of God, your owne ſaluation, and the adminiſtration of the truth, if you deſire that God ſhould be mercifull vnto you in your goods temporall and ſpirituall. For you can do nothing without him; and if you deſire to be heires of his glorie, do that which he commandeth: If you will enter into life keepe my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. Likewiſe be carefull that there be not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed amongſt you any ſports, gluttony, whoredome, dancings, nor any leudneſſe or riot, nor queſtions, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, nor vſury, nor diſcords; neither ſupport or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any perſons that are of a wicked conuerſation, or that giue any ſcandall or ill example amongſt you, but let charitie and fidelitie reigne amongſt you, &amp; all good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; doing to one another as euery one deſires ſhould be done vnto himſelfe. For otherwiſe it is not poſſible that any man ſhould be ſaued, or can haue the grace either of God or man in this world, or glorie in another. And it is neceſſarie that the conductors principally ſhould haue a hand herein, and ſuch as rule and gouerne. For when the head is ſicke all the members are likewiſe ill affected. And therefore if you hope and deſire to poſſeſſe eternall life, to liue in good eſteeme and credit, and to proſper in this world in your goods temporall and ſpirituall, purge your ſelues from all diſorderly waies, to the end that God may be alwayes with you, who neuer forſaketh thoſe that truſt in him. But know this for a certaine, that God heareth not nor dwelleth with ſinners, nor in the ſoule that is giuen vnto wickedneſſe, nor in the man that is ſubiect vnto ſin. And therfore let euery one cleanſe the wayes of his heart, and flie the danger if he would not periſh therein. I haue no other thing to write at this preſent, but that you would
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173840:36"/>put in practiſe theſe things: And the God of peace be with you all, and accompanie vs in our true, deuout, and humble prayers, that he will be pleaſed to ſaue all thoſe his faithfull that truſt in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wholly yours Barthelmew Tertian, readie to do you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in all things poſſible according vnto the will of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Epiſtle of the Paſtor <hi>Tertian</hi> giues vs aſſurance of that holy affection which they had to leade the people of God; but the Confeſſion of the faith of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> found in the bookes of thoſe Paſtors aboue mentioned, ſhall ſhew vs more clearely how pure their beliefe hath bene, and how farre from thoſe hereſies and errors that haue bene imputed vnto them. And that therefore they haue bene very vniuſtly perſecuted.</p>

                  <p>We beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is the Sonne and image of his father;<note place="margin">Art. 2.</note> that in him dwels the fulneſſe of the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; by whom we know the Father, who is our media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and aduocate, and there is no other name vnder heauen giuen vnto men by which we can be ſaued; in whoſe name onely we call vpon the Father, and vſe no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prayers but thoſe that are contained in the holy Scriptures, or agreeing vnto them in ſubſtance.</p>

                  <p>We beleeue that there is one holy Church,<note place="margin">Art. 4.</note> which is the congregation of all the elect and faithfull, which haue bene from the beginning of the world, and ſhall be vnto the end, whereof our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is the head: the which Church is gouerned by his word, and guided by the holy Ghoſt, in which all good Chriſtians ought to remaine: for it prayeth without ceaſſing for all, and the

                  <p>We hold that the Miniſters of the Church ought to be irreprehenſible both in life and doctrine,<note place="margin">Art. 5.</note> otherwiſe they are to be depoſed from their office, and other to be ſubſtituted in their place. And that no man ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to vndertake this honourable calling, but onely he which is called of God as <hi>Aaron,</hi> nouriſhing the flocke of Chriſt, not for diſhoneſt gaine, or as hauing any ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie ouer the Clergie, but as being an example to the flocke, in word, in conuerſation, in charitie, in faith, and in chaſtitie.</p>
                  <p>We confeſſe that Kings,<note place="margin">Art. 6.</note> Princes, and Gouernours are ordained and eſtabliſhed Miniſters of God, to whom we are to obey. For they carrie the ſword for the defence of innocents and the puniſhment of malefactors; and for this cauſe are we bound to do them honour, and to pay tribute. From which power and authoritie no man can exempt himſelfe, as may appeare be the example of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who refuſed not to pay tribute, not challenging any iuriſdiction of temporall power.</p>

                  <p>The beliefe of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> is ſufficiently knowne by that which is contained in the pure &amp; holy doctrines of their confeſſions aboue mentioned: and yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is for the ſame that they haue bene perſecuted for the ſpace of foure hundred and fiftie yeares, &amp; ſtill ſhould be if they liued neare thoſe places where humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are preferred before the word of God. For though Satan be confounded, and his kingdome diſſipated by the brightneſſe of the Goſpell, yet he ceaſſeth not to hold thoſe vnder the yoke of Idolatrie, whoſe vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173840:41"/>dings he hath blinded, and to keepe them by violence vnder the tyrannie of his lawes, hiding that ignorance and errour that men do naturally loue, in thoſe darkneſſes wherein they take pleaſure. But as it hath not pleaſed the eternall God, that the faith of his ſeruants and Martyrs ſhould be buried, ſo it likewiſe pleaſeth him, that their conſtancie ſhould be made manifeſt for our edification and example.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173840:43"/>Country in which it hath not taken footing. And thirdly, becauſe all other by their blaſphemies againſt God, ſtrike a horror into mens hearts; But this on the contrary, hath a great appearance of piety, for they carry themſelues vprightly before men, and beleeue rightly touching God in all things, holding all the Articles that are contained in the Simbole, hating and reuiling the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therein (ſaith he) they are eaſily beleeued of the people.</p>
                  <p>And in another place the ſaid <hi>Rainerius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rainer. cap. de ſtudio peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendi alios &amp; mode decendi. fol. 98.</note> that the firſt leſſon that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> giue to thoſe whom they winne to their Sect, is this, that they teach them what the Diſciples of Chriſt ought to be, and that by the words of the Goſpell and the Apoſtles, affirming, that they onely are the Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, that immitate their life. Inferring thereby(ſaith hee) that the Pope, the Biſhoppes and Clergy, that poſſeſſe and inioy the riches of this world, and ſeek after them, follow not the examples of the Apoſtles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are not the true guides of the Church, it neuer being the purpoſe of Chriſt Ieſus, to commit his chaſte and beloued ſpouſe, to thoſe who rather proſtitute her by their ill examples, and wicked actions, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue her in that purity wherein they receiued her at the beginning, a virgin chaſte and without ſpot.</p>
                  <p>In hatred therefore of diuers diſcourſes which the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> haue written againſt the luxury, auarice, pride, and errors brought in by the Pope, they haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies perſecuted them to the death.</p>
                  <p>The meanes they haue vſed vtterly to exterminate them, haue been in the firſt place their thunderbolts, curſes, cannons, conſtitutions, decrees, and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer elſe might make them odious to the Kings, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:173840:43"/>and people of the earth, giuing them ouer, aſmuch as lies in their power, vnto Satan, interdicting them all communion and ſociety with thoſe that obey their lawes, iudging them vnworthy and vncapable of any charges, honours, profits, or to inherit, or to make willes, or to beburied in common church-yards, confiſcating their goods, diſ-inheriting their heires, and where they could by any meanes apprehend them, they haue condemned them to be deliuered to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular power, their houſes to be razed, their lands and moueables confiſcated, or giuen to the firſt conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. And of all theſe ſentences we haue at this day the ſcedule, giuen by the Popes,<note place="margin">Theſe ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to bee ſeen in the manuel of the Inquiſitors, with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Pope Alexander the thirteenth &amp; of diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popes which ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him.</note> with the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they haue imployed to ſuch executions, as alſo of the commands which they haue giuen vnto Kings, Princes, Magiſtrates, Conſuls and People, to make an exact inquiſition, to ſhut the gates of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to craue the aſſiſtance, and beſt helpe of the people, to ring the Tol-bell, to arme themſelues: and if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they cannot be apprehended, to kill them, and to vſe all manner of violence, which they ſhall ſee need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in ſuch a caſe: Giuing to the accuſers the third part, or ſome other portion of that which ſhall bee confiſcated, all councellors and fauourers of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned to the ſame puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as no Prince or Magiſtrate, or any other had any power to frame a proces againſt any in the fact of pretended hereſie; commandement was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Biſhops, euery one in his iuriſdiction, to make an inquiry into their flockes, and take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how euery particular perſon was affected, to the ordinances of the Popes, and the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So when <hi>Waldo</hi> began to complaine and to cry
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173840:44"/>out againſt the corruptions, of the ſaid Church of <hi>Rome. Alexander</hi> the third then Pope, enioyned the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Lion</hi> to proceed againſt him; and foraſmuch as the ſaid Prelate did not baniſh him according and as ſoon as he deſired,<note place="margin">This Councel was held at Latran. 1180.

                  <p>But this meanes was thought to be too eaſie for ſo preſſing an action as this of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> was, who ceaſed not for all thoſe thunderbolts, to preach, that the Pope was <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> the <hi>Maſſe</hi> an abomination, the <hi>Hoste</hi> an idoll, and <hi>Purgatory</hi> a fable. Points that being receiued were ſufficient to ouerthrow all the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope, &amp; to drie vp all the riuers of gaine and greaſe of the Clergy. And therefore <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, who ſucceeded Pope <hi>Celeſtine</hi> the third of that name, about the yeer 1198, tooke another courſe then that of the ordinary Biſhoppes, to frame the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and others whom he called Heretickes. He authorized certaine Monkes, who had the full power of the Inquiſition in their hands, and framed the Proces, deliuered to the ſecular power, by a full and abſolute authority, and a far ſhorter way, but much more cruell, deliuering the people by thouſands into the hands of the Magiſtrates, &amp; the Magiſtrates to the executioners; whereby in a few yeers, all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was much moued by thoſe pittifull &amp; lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpectacles, to ſee all thoſe burnt or hanged, that did truſt only in one Lord Ieſus.

                  <p>The power giuen to theſe Monkes Inquiſitors, was without limits. For they could aſſemble the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whenſoeuer it pleaſed them, by the ſound of a bell, proceed againſt the Biſhops themſelues, and ſend out proces, if there were need, to impriſon, and to open the priſons without controle. All manner of accuſations was auailable enough: A Sorcerer, a Harlot were ſufficient witneſſes, without reproch, in the fact of pretended hereſie. It was no matter who did accuſe, or whether by word of mouth, or by tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets caſt in before the Inquiſitor, for without any perſonall appearance, or confronting one another, the the proces were framed, without party, without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and without other law, then the pleaſure of the Inquiſitor. To be rich was a crime neere vnto hereſie, and he that had any thing to loſe, was in the way to bee vndone, either as an Hereticke, or at the leaſt, as a fauourer of heretikes. One bare ſuſpition ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the mouthes of fathers and mothers, and kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke, that they durſt not intercede for puniſhments to come, and he that did intreat for the conuey of a cup of cold water, or a little ſtraw to lye vpon in ſome ſtinking dungeon, was condemned for a fauourer of Heretickes, and brought to the ſame or worſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. There was no Aduocate that durſt vndertake the defence of his neareſt kinſman or friend, or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary that durſt receiue any act in his fauour. And that which was more, after that a man was once intangled within the ſnares of the Inquiſition, he could neuer liue in any aſſurance, for hee was alwaies to beginne
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173840:46"/>againe: For if any man were ſet at liberty, it was only for a time till they might better conſider of it. Death it ſelfe made not an end of the puniſhment, for they haue left vnto vs certaine coppies of their ſentences againſt the bones of the dead, to diſ-interre and to burne them, yea thirty yeeres after the deceaſe of the party accuſed. They that were heires had nothing certaine, for vpon any accuſation of their fathers or kindred, they durſt not vndertake the defence of their owne right, or poſſeſſe their owne inheritance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the crime or ſuſpition of Hereſie, and that they rather inherited their bad faith and opinions then their goods. The people, yea the moſt mighty and richeſt amongſt them, were conſtrained, in a manner, to adore theſe Monkes the Inquiſitors, and to beſtow vpon them great Preſents for the building of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents and dotations of their houſes, for feare to bee accuſed of Hereſie, and not to be eſtemed zealous for the faith of thoſe holy fathers. And the better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine men with an apprehenſion of theſe things, they ſometimes made ſhewes and brauadoes of their priſoners, leading them in triumph at their Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome being enioyned to whip themſelues, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to goe couered after the manner of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Benedicts,</hi> that is to ſay, with certaine red Caſſockes with yellow croſſes, to ſignifie that they were ſuch as had been conuinced of ſome errour, and that at the firſt offence they ſhould afterward commit, they were already condemned for Heretickes. Others appeared in their ſhirts, bare-foote and bare-headed, with a with about their neckes, a torch in their hands; that being thus prepared and furniſhed, they might giue terror to the beholders, to ſee ſuch perſons of all eſtates and ſex,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173840:46"/>brought to ſo miſerable a condition, being all forbid to enter into the Church, but to ſtay in the porch, or to caſt an eye vpon the Hoſte when it was ſhewed by the Prieſt; vntill it was otherwiſe determined by the Fathers the Inquiſitors.</p>
                  <p>And for the full accompliſhment of the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Fathers, their accuſed were exiled for a penance, into the holy Land, or enrolled for ſome other expedition againſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> or other Infidels, leuied by the command of the Pope, to ſerue the Church for a certaine time at their owne charge: and in the meane time, the ſaid holy Fathers tooke poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the goods of the poore Pilgrims; and that which was worſt of all, at their returne, they muſt not enquire whether the ſaid Monkes had in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence any priuate familiarity with their wiues, for feare leſt they ſhould be condemned for back-ſliders, impenitent, and altogether vnworthy of any fauour.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe violences being executed from the yeer a thouſand two hundred and ſix, which was about the time that <hi>Dominique</hi> erected his Inquiſition, to the yeere one thouſand two hundred twenty eight, there was ſo great a hauock made of poore Chriſtians, that the Archbiſhops of <hi>Aix, Arles,</hi> and <hi>Narbonne,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembled together at <hi>Aingou,</hi> in the ſaid yeere 1228, at the inſtance of the ſaid Monkes the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to confer with them about diuers difficulties in the execution of their charge, had compaſſion of the miſery of a great number that were accuſed, and kept in priſon by the ſaid Monkes the Inquiſitors, ſaying:</p>
                  <p>It is come to our knowledge,<note place="margin">See the Catal. of the Teſt. of the truth. pag. 534.</note> that you haue appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſo great a number of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that it is not only not poſſible to defray the charge of their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173840:47"/>nouriſhment, but to prouide lyme and ſtone to build priſons for them; we therefore counſell you (ſay they) that you defer a little ſuch impriſonments, vntill the Pope may bee aduertiſed of the great numbers that haue been apprehended, and that he doe aduiſe what pleaſeth him to bee done; if not, there is no reaſon you ſhould <hi>take offence</hi> for thoſe that are impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and incorigible,<note place="margin">Vous tuiſſies.</note> or that you ſhould doubt of their relaps, or that they ſhould eſcape away, or hauing their liberty ſhould infect others, becauſe you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne ſuch perſons without delay.</p>
                  <p>There needs no other proofe then this of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Prelats, to make it appeare that the number of thoſe whom the Inquiſition had deliuered vnto death, was very great. For touching the queſtion moued by the ſaid Inquiſitors, whether they that haue frequented the company of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and haue receiued the Supper of the Lord with them, are to be excuſed, becauſe they ſay they offended out of ignorance, not knowing that they were <hi>Waldenſes:</hi> The the anſwer of the ſaid Prelats was, that they were not to be excuſed; Becauſe (ſay they) who is ſo great a ſtranger, as not to know that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> haue been puniſhed and condemned for theſe many yeers ſince, and who knoweth, not that for a long time they haue been purſued and perſecuted at the charge and trauell of Catholikes, this purſuit being ſealed by ſo many perſons condemned to death; if it cannot be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doubt.</p>
                  <p>And yet neuertheles, the ſpeech of the ſaid Prelats being conferred, with that which <hi>George Morell,</hi> in the yeer a thouſand fiue hundred and thirty, hath written, it would be none of the leaſt wonders that God hath
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:173840:47"/>wrought, that notwithſtanding the bloody perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after <hi>Waldo</hi> his time, in the yeere a thouſand one hundred ſixty, there were according to the report of <hi>Morel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">George Morel in his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials. pa. 54.</note> aboue eight hundred thouſand perſons that made profeſſion of the faith of the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As touching the ſubtleties of the ſaid Inquiſitors, we ſhould not haue had any knowledge thereof, but from ſuch as haue eſcaped from the Inquiſition of <hi>Spaine,</hi> but that it was the will of God that their cunning trickes ſhould not bee ſo cloſely hid, but that wee had examples thereof euen from themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Behold then the crafty ſubtleties of the Inquiſitors, which ſerued them for a rule in the framing of their proces againſt the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not expedient to diſpute of matter of faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay-people.</p>
                  <p>No man ſhall be held for a penitent man, if he accuſe not thoſe that he knowes to be ſuch as himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>He that accuſeth not thoſe that are like vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhall be cut off from the Church, as a rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for feare leſt the members that are ſound, ſhould be corrupted by him.</p>
                  <p>After that any one hath been deliuered to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power, great care muſt bee taken, that hee bee not ſuffered to excuſe himſelfe, or to manifeſt his inn ocencie before the people: becauſe if be he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to death, it is a ſcandall to the lay-people; and if hee make an eſcape, there is danger of his loyalty.</p>
                  <p>Good heed muſt bee taken, not to promiſe live vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that is condemned to death, before the people, conſidering that an Heretike will neuer ſuffer himſelfe to bee burnt, if hee may eſcape by ſuch promiſes.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173840:48"/>And if he ſhall promiſe to repent before the people, if he haue not his life granted vnto him, there will ariſe a ſcandall amongſt them, and it will be thought that he is wrongfully put to death.</p>
                  <p>Note (ſay they) that the Inquiſitor ought alwaies to preſuppoſe the fact, without any condition, and is onely to enquire of the circumſtances of the fact, as thus: how often haſt thou confeſſed thy ſelfe vnto Heretickes? In what chamber of the houſe haue they layen, and the like things.</p>
                  <p>The Inquiſitor may looke into any booke, as if he found there written, the life of him that is accuſed, and of all that he enquires of.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary to threaten death to the accuſed, if he confeſſe not, and to tell him the fact is too manifeſt, that it is fit he ſhould thinke of his ſoule, and renounce his Hereſie, for he muſt die, and therefore it ſhall bee good for him to take patiently whatſoeuer ſhall light vpon him. And if he ſhall anſwer; ſince I muſt die, I had rather die in that faith I profeſſe, then in that of the Romiſh Church, then conclude for certaine, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he made but a ſhew of repentance, and ſo let him ſuffer iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Wee muſt not thinke to vanquiſh Heretickes by learning or by the ſcriptures, inaſmuch as men that are learned, are rather confounded by them, whereby it comes to paſſe, that the Heretickes fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſeeing they are able to delude the moſt learned.</p>
                  <p>Againe, great heed muſt bee taken that the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes neuer anſwer directly, and when they are preſſed by frequent interrogations, they haue a cuſtome to alledge for themſelues, that they are ſimple and fooliſh
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173840:48"/>people, and therefore know not how to anſwere. And if they ſhall once ſee the aſſiſtants to bee moued with compaſſion towar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s them, as if they ſhould doe them wrong, thinking them to be ſimple people, and therefore not culpable; then they gather heart, and make a ſhew of ſhedding teares like poore miſerable creatures, and flattering their iudges, they endeauour to free themſelues from the Inquiſition, ſaying: Sir, If I haue been faulty in any thing, I will willingly doe penance, but yet giue me your aide and aſſiſtance to deliuer me from this infamy, into which I am fallen by the malice of others, not mine owne fault.</p>
                  <p>But then the couragious Inquiſitor muſt not yeeld for all theſe flatteries, nor giue any beliefe to thoſe diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulations.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer the Inquiſitor muſt tell them, that they ſhall gaine nothing by ſwearing falſly, becauſe they haue enough to conuince them by witneſſes; and therefore they muſt not thinke, that by meanes of their oath they ſhall auoide the ſentence of death; but they muſt promiſe them (ſay they) that if they will freely confeſſe their error, they ſhall haue mercy; for in ſuch perplexities, there are many, that confeſſe their error in hope to eſcape.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the ſubtilties of the Monkes the Inquiſitors, ſuch as they practiſed in times paſt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> throughout all Europe: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines that we now ſee what their practiſe hath been in euery particular Realme and Prouince, ſo far forth as is come to our knowledge.

                     <note place="margin">Valentinois.</note> where at this preſent there are places, wherin times out of mind, the faith of the <hi>Walde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſes</hi> hath been receiued from the father to the ſonne, as the place <hi>des Faulques,</hi> and <hi>Beauregard</hi> in <hi>Valentia,</hi> and <hi>La Baulme</hi> neere <hi>Crest;</hi> out of which places there are come to our hands certaine proces againſt ſome particular perſons of the ſame places, for being accuſed by the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors as adhearing to the faith of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> aboue three hundred yeeres ſince. But the more famous Churches of the ſaide Prouince, are thoſe of the Valley of <hi>Fraiſsiniere,</hi> neere <hi>Ambrun,</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genterie,</hi> of the Valley <hi>Loyſe,</hi> which for the <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> ſakes was called <hi>Val lute,</hi> as if there had been nothing in the ſaid Valley but a Brothel-houſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of all manner of diſſolute liuing and villany. This was vtterly rooted out. On the other ſide of the Alpes, there is a valley called the Valley of <hi>Pragela,</hi> where they haue inhabited time out of minde. A Valley that is in the iuriſdiction of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Turin,</hi> peopled euen at this preſent with thoſe that are deſcended from the firſt <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> of whom men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173840:49"/>hath been made heretofore. They were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this Valley that peopled the <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Valleies of <hi>Piedmont, La Perouſe, Saint Martin, Angrongue</hi> and others; as alſo thoſe of the <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> inhabited in <hi>Prouence,</hi> and <hi>Calabria,</hi> are come out of thoſe places of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> and <hi>Piedmont.</hi> In ſaid Valley of <hi>Pragela,</hi> there are at this day, ſix goodly Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, euery one hauing their Paſtor, and euerie Paſtor hauing diuers villages, which belong to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of theſe Churches, all filled with thoſe that haue deſcended from the ancient <hi>VValdenſes.</hi> They are Churches truely reformed time out of minde. For although in the ſaid Valley, there are at this preſent old people, and not a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that draw neere, yea and ſome that are aboue a hundred yeere old, yet theſe good old men, haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of their fathers, or grand-fathers, that maſſe was euer ſung in their times in that Country. And though perhaps the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Turin,</hi> haue cauſed it to be ſong in the ſaid Valley, whereof the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants haue had no knowledge, yet there is not any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that makes profeſſion of any other faith or beleefe, then that the confeſſion whereof we haue heard in the former booke.</p>
                  <p>For all thoſe bookes before mentioned, haue bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by the Inhabitants of the ſaid valley, which hath been in times paſt, one of the ſafeſt retiring pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> had in all Europe, enuironed on all ſides with mountaines almoſt vnaccreſſable, within the caues whereof they retired themſelues in times of perſecution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Le Sieur de Vignaux</hi> who was one of the firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors that preached to his people, long before
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173840:50"/>the exerciſe of the reformed Religion was free in <hi>France,</hi> could not ſatisfie himſelfe with the liberall ſpeech, integrity, and piety of theſe people, whom he found altogether diſpoſed to receiue the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word of God, which their fore-fathers had cheriſhed, and in which they had inſtructed their poſterity. And it was worthy the obſeruation, that notwithſtanding they were weakned on all ſides, and enuironed with the enemies of their Religion, in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be apprehended when they went out of their dores, yet was there neuer any worldly reſpect that had power to alter their holy reſolution, from the father to the ſonne to ſerue God, taking his word for the rule of their faith, and his law for the rule of their obedience. And in this deſigne it was, that they haue been bleſſed of God, aboue all Chriſtian people throughout Europe, inſomuch that their infants were hardly weaned from their mothers breaſt, but their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents tooke a ſingular delight to inſtruct them in the Chriſtian faith and doctrine, vntill they were able to confound many perſons dwelling elſwhere well ſtroo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in yeeres, and ouerwhelmed with ignorance.</p>
                  <p>To this paſſe their Paſtors brought them, who not being content to giue them exhortations vpon the Sabboth daies, went alſo in the weeke-daies to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them, in the villages and hamlets thereabouts, not ſparing themſelues for the roughnes of the rockes, the coldneſſe of the ayre, the inciuility of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where they were faine to clime vp high mountains to viſit their flocke, and to carry vnto them the foode of their ſoules; euen at thoſe times when the people in the heat of ſummer were keeping their cattell vpon the high rockes, and there they many times teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173840:50"/>them in the open fields. There you may ſee thoſe that heare the word of God with attention and reuerence: There is diſcipline exerciſed with fruit; There the people pray with feruency of zeale, at their retaine from their labors, at night when they go toe their reſt, &amp; in the morning before they vndertake any worke; Firſt in their priuate houſes, then in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they begge the aſſiſtance of the Lord in all their actions, thoughts, words, and deeds, and ſo betake themſelues to their labours, vnder the protection of the liuing God, whom they loue, and honour and adore. There you may deſcry more zeale, and more ſimplicity, then in many other places, that abound in the delights and pleaſures of this world; neither are they ſo rude and blockiſh, but that they haue diuers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that can reade, and deliuer their mindes in good tearmes, eſpecially they that trauell ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into the lower Countries for their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; they haue Schooles wherein their children are taught and nurtured, neither doe they want any thing they thinke neceſſary to aduance the glory of God amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt perſecution that is come to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, was that, which was moued by a certain Monke Inquiſitor of the Order of the Frier-Minors, named <hi>Francis Borelli,</hi> hauing a Commiſſion in the yeere 1380,<note place="margin">Anno 1380.</note> to make inquiry and to informe touching the Sect of the Waldenſes, in the Dioces of <hi>Aix, Arles, Ambrun, Vienna, Geneua, Aubonne, Sauoy,</hi> the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> County, <hi>Dyois, Foreſts,</hi> the Principality of <hi>Orenge,</hi> the Citty of <hi>Anignon</hi> and <hi>Selon,</hi>

                     <hi>Anignon.</hi> By reaſon of the neerenes of his Court to the habitation of the <hi>Waldenſes;</hi> hee thought good to purge <hi>Dauphine,</hi> of thoſe that held him to bee Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; and for this cauſe he commanded the Biſhops of <hi>Dauphine, Pronence,</hi> and other places, to which his power did extend (for there was then a ſchiſme, and all Europe was diuided, partly for <hi>Vrbani</hi> the ſixt, and partly for this ſaid <hi>Clement</hi>) to watch in ſuch ſort ouer their flockes, that there might not any liue amongſt them that was of the Sect of the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>

                  <p>Hitherto we haue not found that any haue hotly purſued the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> by war; but <hi>Albert de Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neis,</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Cremona,</hi> ſent againſt them by <hi>Innocent</hi> the eight, in the yeere one thouſand, foure hundred,<note place="margin">1488.</note> eighty eight, began to intreat the aſſiſtance of the Kings Lieutenant in <hi>Dauphine</hi> called <hi>Hugnes de la Paln,</hi> who for this ſeruice leuied troopes of men, and marched to thoſe places, where the ſaid <hi>Albert</hi> told him there were any of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> namely in the valley of <hi>Loyſe.</hi> And to the end the buſines ſhould ſeeme to be vndertaken according to a forme of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and to giue the better authority to that which by them ſhould be executed, the ſaid Lieutenant of the King tooke in his company a Counſeller of the Court, named M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Rabot.</hi> Being arriued at the ſaid val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley <hi>Loyſe,</hi> they found none of the Inhabitants, to whom they might ſpeake a word; for they had all retired themſelues into their cauernes into the high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, hauing carried thither with them their little children and whatſoeuer was moſt pretious vnto them, and fit for nouriſhment. This Lieutenant of the King cauſed a great quantity of wood to be laid at the entrance of their caues or cauernes, and fire to be put vnto it, in ſuch manner that either the ſmoake by ſmothering them, or the fire by burning them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained a great number, to caſt themſelues headlong from their cauernes vpon the rockes below, where they ended their liues, being broken in peeces, and if there were any amongſt them that durſt to ſtirre, hee was preſently ſlaine by the ſouldiers of the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Varax,</hi> Lord of <hi>Paln.</hi> This perſecution was very extreame; For there were found within the ſaid cauernes foure hundred ſmall infants, ſtifled in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173840:58"/>their cradles, or in the armes of their dead mothers. It is held for a certaine truth amongſt the <hi>VValdenſes</hi> of the neighbouring Valleis, that there then died aboue three thouſand perſons, men and women of the ſaid Valley. And to ſay the truth they were wholly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, in ſuch ſort, that from that time forward, the ſaid Valley was peopled with new Inhabitants, there was no family of the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes</hi> that euer tooke footing there; which is a certain proofe that all the Inhabitants thereof of both ſexes died at that time. This Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the King, hauing deſtroyed the ſaid Inhabitants of the Valley <hi>Loyſe,</hi> fearing leſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> ſhould ſettle themſelues there againe, &amp; to the end they might not one day be troubled againe to chaſe them out, he gaue the goods and poſſeſſions of the ſaid Valley, to whom it pleaſed him, which was no ſooner parted amongſt them, but the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Pragela,</hi> and <hi>Fraſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieres</hi> had prouided for their ſafety, attending the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at the paſſages, and narrow ſtraites of their Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leies, in ſuch manner, that when the ſaid Leiutenant of the King came to inuade them, hee was conſtrained honeſtly to retire. <hi>Albert de Capetaneis</hi> being called elſewhere by his Commiſſion, ſurrogated a certaine Monke of the Order of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> named <hi>Francis Ploieri,</hi> who began to informe anew againſt the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi> of <hi>Fraſsiniere,</hi> in the yeere one thouſand foure hundred eighty nine.<note place="margin">1489.</note> He citeth them to appeare before him at <hi>Ambrun,</hi> and for not appearing, he excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateth them, curſeth and recurſeth them, and in the end condemned them for Heretickes, partinacious, and backſliders, to be deliuered to the ſecular power, and their goods confiſcated. To this iudgement there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:173840:59"/>in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> a certaine Counceller thereof named <hi>Ponce,</hi> to the end that this mixt iudgement might be without appeale. The ſentence was pronounced in the great Church at <hi>Ambrun,</hi> afterward faſtned vpon the doore of the ſaid Church in a great Table, in the lower part whereof, there were thirty two Articles of the beleefe of the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that is to ſay, againſt the Maſſe, Purgatory, the Inuocation of the Saints, Pilgrimage, the obſeruation of Feaſts, diſtinction of Viandes vpon certaine daies, and other matters that were affirmed by the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this Inquiſitor added to the Articles of their beleefe, that they held, that for the augmentation of humane kind, a man might company with his owne ſiſter, neece, or other in any degree of proximity whatſoeuer, becauſe God hath ſaid, Increaſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply.</p>
                  <p>Againe, that euery man that burneth in luſt, may carnally know any woman whatſoeuer, without ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, that it is better to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then to burne, and becauſe it is ſaid in the Goſpell <hi>(qui poteſt capere capiat)</hi> interpreting it thus, catch hee that catch can.</p>
                  <p>Now the informations vpon which they groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their ſentence being come to our hands, this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture hath been dicouered to their owne condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: for there is not any witnes, or at leaſt wiſe the greateſt part of thoſe that were heard; but they were Prieſts or Monkes, who being demanded by the ſaid Monke, whether they knew this beleefe contained in the aforeſaid Articles to be true, anſwered, that they neuer knew, amongſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> any ſuch things ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taught or practiſed.</p>

                     <hi>about the hill in the ſide of the Plaine,</hi> the one named <hi>Francis Gerondin,</hi> the other <hi>Peter Iames,</hi> in the yeere one thouſand foure hundred ninety two.<note place="margin">1492.</note> Being demanded why the Sect of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> grew and increaſed ſo faſt, and for a long time together had ſpred it ſelfe into ſo many places. This Monke thus ſets downe the anſwere of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor <hi>Gerondin;</hi> That the diſſolute life of the Prieſts was the cauſe, and becauſe the Cardinals were coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, proud, luxurious, being a thing knowne vnto all, that there was neither Pope, Cardinall, nor Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that kept not their whores; few or none that had not their youth for Sodomy: and therefore it was an eaſie matter for the <hi>VValdenſian</hi> Paſtors, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people, that the Religion of ſuch ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons was not good, ſince their fruits were ſo bad. And preſently after, the ſaid Paſtor being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, what they taught touching Luxury: They make him to anſwer, that luxury is no ſinne, except it be betwixt the mother and her childe. As if it had been poſſible that the Paſtors could haue drawne the people from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by condemning the luxury of the Prieſts, if they themſelues ſhould teach, that luxury was no ſin. Againe, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded why the inceſt of the childe with the mother was a ſin, they make him to anſwere; becauſe God hath forbidden it; And being asked, where hee hath forbidden it, they make him to ſay, that Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaid vnto <hi>Iohn</hi> before he aſcended vp into heauen, <hi>Garde to doue ſer ay failli vna volta non tornar piu.</hi> That
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:173840:60"/>is to ſay, Take heed thou enter not into that place from whence thou once cameſt. And all this was thus ſet downe and ſubſcribed, not onely by the dictat and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the ſaid Monke, but by the approbation and ſignature of the Councellor <hi>Ponce,</hi> and one <hi>Oronce</hi> Iudge of <hi>Briancon.</hi> Wherin appeares the priuat conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and vniuſt confederation of the ſaid Inquiſitors, in that they were not content to perſecute them with violence, but to oppreſſe them with calumnies, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſaid Paſtors to anſwer ſo vnaptly &amp; childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touching thoſe things wherein (as it ſhall appeare in it due place, that is to ſay, in their expoſition vpon the ſixt Commandement) the ſaid Paſtors were throughly exerciſed in the Scriptures, and therefore that it is a plaine impoſture which they haue forged, and an idle tradition, in which expoſition they leaue nothing to ſay againſt luxury and incontinency of all that is taught vs in the word of God.</p>
                  <p>This perſecution was very extreame: for the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> being condemned by the Inquiſitor as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes; <hi>Ponce</hi> the Counſeller, and <hi>Oronce</hi> Iudges, ſent them to the fire without appeale; and that which multiplied the number of thoſe that were perſecuted, was, that whoſoeuer did any way mediat for them, whoſoeuer hee were, whether it were the child for the father, or the father for the child, he was preſently impriſoned, and his indictment framed, as a fauourer of Heretickes.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere one thouſand foure hundred ninety foure, <hi>Anthony Fabri</hi> Doctor and Canon of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher de Salliens</hi> Canon Vicar, and Officiall of the Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> had Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Pope to commence ſuit againſt the <hi>VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:173840:60"/>in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Chagnards. Fabri</hi> the Inquiſitor, and one <hi>Gobandi</hi> Notary of <hi>Ambrun</hi> and Secretary to the ſaid Inquiſitors carried to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun</hi> a certaine indictment framed againſt <hi>Peironette</hi> of <hi>Beauregard</hi> in <hi>Valentinois,</hi> the widdow of one <hi>Peter Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> of whom we doe not make mention for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, but becauſe ſhee deliuered in her anſweres ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things that may adde ſome things to this Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Being therefore demanded whether ſhee had ſeen, or vnderſtood of any of the Paſtors of the <hi>VValdenſes,</hi> ſhee anſwered at the firſt, that ſhee had not, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to anſwere to all interrogatories negatiuely. The Inquiſitors ordained, that becauſe ſhee had not ſatisfied their demands, ſhee ſhould bee conueied to the priſon of the Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> who being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be further vrged touching the queſtion, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that about ſome twenty fiue yeeres ſince, there were two men clothed in gray, that came to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands houſe, &amp; that after ſupper, the one of them asked her, <hi>N'aues vous iamais auui parlar d'un plen pung de mond, que ſi non era tot lo monde ſeria afin.</hi> That is to ſay, Whether ſhee had heard any ſpeech of a handfull of people that are in the world, without which the world muſt haue an end. Hauing anſwered that ſhee neuer heard any ſpeech therereof, but of one <hi>Monſen Andre,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Beauregard,</hi> who often told her, that there was a ſmall number of people in the world, without whom the world muſt periſh; and that then he likewiſe told her, that he was now come thither, to confer with her about that little flocke, and to giue her to vnderſtand, that they were the men, that had learnt by the Commandements of God, how to ſerue him, &amp; that they trauelled about the world to inſtruct men,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:173840:61"/>how they ought to adore and honour him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the abuſes of the Churche of <hi>Rome.</hi> Againe, that among other things he told her, that we ought not to doe any thing to another, which wee would not haue done vnto our ſelues; That wee are to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one onely God, Who is onely able to helpe vs, and not the Saints departed; That wee ought not to Sweare; That we are to keep faith in marriage, and to keepe holy the Sabboth day, but that theee was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of obſeruing other Feaſts. That Eccleſiaſticall perſons were too rich, which was the cauſe why they maintained their ſtrumpets, and liued ſcandalouſly; and that of the Pope hee ſaid in his language; <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant crois &amp; autant maluais es lo Papa coma neugun au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, &amp; per co non ages de poiſsanſa.</hi> That is to ſay, that the Pope is as bad, or rather worſe then any other, and therefore he hath no power. Againe, that hee taught that there was no Purgatory, but only Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe for the good, and hell for the wicked. And therefore all the ſingings and ſuffrages for the ſoules of of the dead, by the Prieſts, auaile nothing; nor the walkes, and goings and commings of the Prieſts about the Church-yards, ſinging <hi>Kirieleiſon.</hi> As alſo, that it was better to giue to the poore, then to offer vnto Prieſts, and that it was a vaine thing to bow the knee before the images of Saints.</p>
                  <p>Shee was ſent backe to priſon, and the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row called againe: but perſiſting in her former ſpeach, ſhee added, that the ſaid Paſtors has told her, that the Prieſts that receiued mony for the Maſſes they ſing, were like <hi>Iudas</hi> that ſold his Maſter for ſiluer; and they that gaue mony for their Maſſes, were like the Iewes, that bought Chriſt with mony.</p>

                  <p>The Arch-biſhop replied, that hee would doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vntill he had ſent to the Pope, and that to that purpoſe he had deputed a Maſter in Theology, called Frier <hi>Iohn Columbi,</hi> and he would write to the Pope
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:173840:62"/>and Cardinals, and ſend them a verball report of what had paſſed againſt them, and he would requeſt their aduiſe, how to carry himſelfe in this buſineſſe. But he gaue them afterwards to vnderſtand, that he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no anſwere. Hereupon King <hi>Charles</hi> the eight of that name, King of <hi>France,</hi> being departed this life, the ſaid Arch-biſhop tooke his iourney to the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, in the yeer one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foure hundred ninety eight,<note place="margin">1498.</note> which being come to the knowledge of the ſaid Inhabitants of <hi>Fraſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere,</hi> and knowing too well, that they had no reaſon to expect, that any thing in their fauour could come from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Arch-biſhop would be eaſily intreated, to enioy thoſe goods that had been confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by his predeceſſors, and that hee would be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to make reſtitution of thoſe goods which they had annexed to his Arch-biſhopricke, they reſolued with themſelues to ſend to King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, and to become humble petitioners vnto him, that hee would be pleaſed, to take ſome order for the reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of their goods, the which the ſaid Arch-biſhop, the Monkes Inquiſitors, and diuers others detained from them. The King committed this buſines, to his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor and his Counſell: The Chancellor ſpeaking therof to the Arch-biſhop, he anſwered, that the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution that they demanded, concerned not himſelfe, becauſe the ſaid goods were confiſcated by the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors long time before he was called to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Ambrun:</hi> but there were then at <hi>Paris</hi> (ſaith he) the Preſident of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Rabot,</hi> that were able to anſwere to the ſaid Article, they being the men that had condemned them.</p>

                  <p>The grand Counſell hauing taken knowledge of this buſineſſe, ordained that nothing ſhould be innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that which concerned the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Fraſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere,</hi> the King hauing written to the Pope, that there might be Apoſtolicall Commiſſaries joyned with the ſaid Arch-biſhop as Ordinary, to make an end of this buſines for this time.</p>
                  <p>For the proſecution of the ſaid ordinance, there were named for Apoſtolicall Commiſſioners, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Confeſſor of the Kings, and the Officiall of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who came to <hi>Ambrun,</hi> in the yeere one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fiue hundred and one, and the fourth of Iuly.<note place="margin">1501.</note>

Then Monſieur the Confeſſor continuing in his diſcourſe; ſpake theſe words; <hi>Vos ad me in modum Scribarum &amp; Phariſaeorum Chriſtum accuſantium ad Pilatum acceſsiſtis, cum tantis viris Eccleſiaſticis ad terrendum me: ſed nihil teneo ſub
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:173840:64"/>vobis aut domino veſtro, &amp; de nihilo vos timeo.</hi> That is to ſay; You are come vnto mee as the Scribes and Phariſies, when they accuſed <hi>Christ</hi> before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and with ſo many Eccleſiaſticall perſons, to terrifie mee, but I hold nothing vnder you or your dominion, and I feare you not at all. To which I anſwered, that I brought no more with mee, then thoſe that were accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to beare mee company walking through the Citty. And ſuddenly he commanded the lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to auoid the chamber, then reuoked the ſentences which hee had thundred out againſt mee, againſt all forme of law, ſaying; that it was expedient to vſe thoſe rigorous tearmes in the preſence of the lay-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and eſpecially there being ſome of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> preſent, as more at large touching the kind carriage of Monſier the Confeſſor, and of matters aboue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, it appeares by a publike inſtrument.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee part of the notes of the Arch-biſhop <hi>Roſtain</hi> ſet downe word by word, wherein we finde fundry falſhoods, as for example: He writ in great griefe, that the ſaid Commiſſioners, heard not aboue three or foure witneſſes, and we finde in the ſaid bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of writings for remembrance, of the Arch-biſhop <hi>Roſtain,</hi> a Coppy of informations wherein there were foure and twenty witneſſes heard and examined.</p>
                  <p>Againe he ſaith, that they asked no other queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but if they were good Catholikes or no, to which being well taught, they anſwered yea, and with that anſwere the Commiſſioners contented themſelues: And yet it appeareth that they demanded diuers que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions touching the Euchariſt, Purgatory, Inuocation of Saints, and diuers other points.</p>
                  <p>Againe he ſaith, that the witneſſes were fearefull
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173840:64"/>and durſt not ſpeake, and yet it plainly appeareth, that the witneſſes produced, were for the moſt part Prieſts and Monkes, of the faction of the Arch-biſhop, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by him.</p>
                  <p>Againe, that they ſuffered nothing to be ſet downe in writing; whereas it appeareth, that there are no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments where there is more written, then in thoſe that were framed by the ſaid Commiſſioners.</p>
                  <p>But that which troubled the Arch-biſhop moſt, was that the ſaid Commiſſioners gaue ſentence of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution touching Contumacy, <hi>ſine praeiudicio cauſae principalis &amp; iuris cuicunque acquiſiti;</hi> againſt which the Arch-biſhop proteſted, and would not yeeld his conſent to ſeale the ſaid ſentence, complaining that Monſieur the Officiall of <hi>Orleans</hi> had made knowen by his proceedings, that he fauoured the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> eſpecially hauing ſaid openly at his lodgiug at the ſigne of the Angell in <hi>Ambrun,</hi> that he deſired to be but as good a Chriſtian, as the worſt of <hi>Fraſsiniere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the greateſt hurt came to himſelfe, for he ſaw that hee muſt reſtore diuers viniards belonging to the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> ſituated at S. <hi>Clements,</hi> S. <hi>Creſpin,</hi> and at the place <hi>Chanteloube,</hi> and diuers inheritances at <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau-Roux,</hi> which his Predeceſſor named <hi>Iohn,</hi> had ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Demaine of his Arch-biſhopricke.</p>
                  <p>The Confeſſor of the King hauing reported vnto him and to his Counſell, what he knew touching the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> and how they were abſolued of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy, did ordaine that the goods of the ſaid <hi>Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſhould be reſtored, whereupon theſe Letters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing were granted by King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth of that name.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Letters being executed, it was the opinion of moſt men, that ſince the faireſt and beſt part of the goods of the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes</hi> was poſſeſſed by the Lord Arch-biſhop, that there was great reaſon, that hee
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:173840:65"/>ſhould giue example vnto others; ſeeing eſpecially, that that which they held, came vnto ſome of them as a ſallary or fee for their puniſhments, and by the hands of the Arch-biſhop <hi>Iohn</hi> his Predeceſſor.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-biſhop <hi>Roſtain</hi> anſwered, that he held none of the goods of the <hi>Fraſsinieres:</hi> onely certaine goods had been annexed to his Arch-biſhopricke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good and iuſt cauſe, and incorporated to his Church, by his Predeceſſor, the ſaid goods being within the territories and iuriſdiction thereof, in which no commandement of the King hath euer been accuſtomed to be executed, and therefore it is not to bee beleeued, that it commeth from the will of the King, being Protector of the Churches, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of his great predeceſſors: But yet neuertheleſſe, the ſaid Arch-biſhop being willing to pleaſe our Lord the King, will bee content to yeeld vnto the ſaid Inhabitants of <hi>Fraſsiniere</hi> the ſaid vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, vpon condition that other the Lords and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> deliuer that which they haue of the ſaid goods, and then the Arch-biſhop will be content to reſtore that which hee and his Church doe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thus theſe poore people were fruſtrated of their attempt. For there was not any one that would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore any thing of that which he detained. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſummoned before the King and his counſell the ſaid Arch-biſhop, Maſter <hi>Pons</hi> Counſellor of the Parliament at <hi>Grenoble, Peter de Rames,</hi> Eſquier, Lord of <hi>Poit, Faix de Rames,</hi> the Maſter of <hi>Montainard,</hi> and of <hi>Argentiere, Arrouars de Bonne,</hi> and diuers other ordinary Atturnies, Prieſts and Burgeſes of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun,</hi> and <hi>Briancon.</hi> They ſent to the Court, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:173840:66"/>hauing there more friends and credit, then the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Fraſsiniere.</hi> Their excuſe was receiued, wherein they declared, that it was not in their power to reſtore the ſaid goods, before the Pope had abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them.</p>
                  <p>And the Arch-biſhop proteſted, that hee for his part, was ready to reſtore all that his Predeceſſors had vnited to his Church, prouided that they had the aforeſaid abſolution. This occaſioned ſuch as were leſſe affected and conſtant, to aſſay this way, and to ſend to Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt of that name, then Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> But they were compelled ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to goe to <hi>Rome,</hi> but to fetch a writ of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from the Cardinall Legat in <hi>France, George</hi> of the title of Saint <hi>Xiſt;</hi> which would ſuffice, and might be obtained with leſſe charge. For the obtaining whereof they had the Commiſſary, the Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor. They ſent therefore one <hi>Steuen Roux,</hi> who who brought two Bulles, one by which he gaue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for Simony, theft, murder, vſury, Adultery, dedention of Benefices, deſtruction of goods Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, violence againſt Clerks, by beating them, vnlawfull oathes, periuries, Fraudes, yea Apoſtacy, and Hereſie, and whoſoeuer had committed any crime, were it neuer ſo hainous, this Cardinall abſolued them from all, by his Apoſtolicall authority.</p>
                  <p>And foraſmuch as his Arch-biſhop might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that the ſaid Bull did not abſolue the ſaid people of <hi>Fraſsinieres,</hi> hauing been condemned by the ſaid Apoſtolicall authority, by Commiſſioners and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors deputed by the Pope, and therefore his mouth was ſtopped, he brought another Bull, in which there was eſpecially this clauſe; <hi>Hauing power from
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:173840:66"/>the Pope to decide or determine any matter, that any other, that hath been deputed by that holy Sea, or ſubſtituted can doe, yea where there hath been an appeale, abſoluing all that haue in any manner been condemned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This poore man thought he had gotten much; and proceeded far in this buſines; but the Arch-biſhop <hi>Roſtain</hi> flouted his Bulles, ſaying that they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with too great a price and importunity, and that he muſt haue an abſolution from the Pope himſelfe. And ſo reſolued with himſelfe to reſtore nothing, and all the reſt followed his example. And notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they had had abſolution from the Pope, yet they would haue reſtored, nothing for he knew well inough that in thoſe daies, all things were ſold at <hi>Rome,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thoſe Latine verſes which were writtena gainſt the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth.</p>

                     <l>Pope Alexander ſold altars, Chriſt, and his croſſe,</l>

                  <p>The Arch-biſhop therfore, was the cauſe, why others kept ſtill thoſe goods in their poſſeſſion, without any reſtitution; and though ſome particular perſons were afterwards called into queſtion, as namely <hi>Le Sieur de Montainar, de Rames,</hi> and others, yet they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue any remedy.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Waldenſes</hi> haue had famous Churches in the Valleis of <hi>Piedmont, Angrongne, la Perouſe,</hi> the Valley Saint <hi>Martin Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerna,</hi> and other bordering places for time out of minde. It is held for certaine amongſt them, that they are a part of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Dauphine, Pragela, Fraſsinieres,</hi> and other places their neere neighbours; and that in time being mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied in ſo great abundance, that the Country could not feed them, they were conſtrained to diſperſe themſelues at length and at large, where they might beſt ſettle themſelues. So deare like brothers, haue they been one to another, and notwithſtanding they haue been alwaies oppreſſed with troubles, yet with a moſt hearty loue and charity, they haue euer ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured one another, not ſparing their liues and goods for their mutuall conſeruation.</p>
                  <p>The firſt troubles that the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Piedmont</hi> endured, came from the report of certaine Prieſts, ſent thither by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Turin,</hi> who informed that the people that were committed to their charge, liued not according to the manners and beliefe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> neither offering for the dead, nor caring for Maſſes, or abſolutions, nor to get any of theirs out of the paines of Purgatory by any of their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:173840:68"/>vſuall meanes. The Arch-biſhops of <hi>Turin</hi> haue perſecuted them, as much as lay in their power, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them odious to their Princes, who vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the good report that their neighbours gaue of their milde &amp; honeſt conuerſation,<note place="margin">

For <hi>Iordan Tertian</hi> was burnt at <hi>Suſe; Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Rouſsier</hi> was burnt at <hi>Turin; Villermin Ambroiſe</hi> was hanged at <hi>Meane;</hi> as alſo <hi>Anthony Hiun, Hugh Chiampe de Feneſtrelles</hi> being taken at <hi>Suſe,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueied to <hi>Turin,</hi> where his bowels were torne out of his belly, and put into a baſon, and hee afterwards cruelly martyred: among which the ſeruants of God, there were ſome who haue maintained that truth, which they haue knowne for aboue two hundred and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173840:68"/>fifty yeeres, and others aboue a hundred and fifty. But amongſt all the reſt, the conſtancy of one <hi>Catelin Girard</hi> is worthy the remembrance, who being vpon the blocke whereon hee ſhould bee burnt at <hi>Reuel</hi> in the Marquiſate of <hi>Saluces,</hi> he requeſted his executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to giue him a coupple of ſtones into his hands, which they refuſed to doe, fearing he had a purpoſe to fling them at ſome one or other, but hee proteſting the contrary, at the laſt they deliuered them vnto him, who hauing them in his hands, ſaid vnto them;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vignaux</hi> in his memorials, fol. 7.</note> when I ſhall haue eaten theſe ſtones, then ſhall ye ſee an end of that religion for which you put me to death, and ſo caſt the ſtones vpon the ground.</p>
                  <p>The fires were kindled vntill the yeere one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foure hundred eighty eight,<note place="margin">1488.</note> at what time they reſolued to aſſault them by open force, becauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they perceiued that the conſtancy of thoſe whom they did publikely put to death, drew a great number of others to the knowledge of God, they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe found that by this meanes they ſhould neuer come to their purpoſed deſigne. And therefore they leuied men to ioyne with <hi>Albert de Capitaneis,</hi> one put in Commiſſion by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, and <hi>Innocent</hi> the eight. There were eighteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouldiers muſtered, beſides a great number of the Inhabitants of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who ran to the pillage from all parts. They marched all at once to <hi>Angrongne, Lucerne, la Perouſe, Saint Martin Prauiglerm,</hi> and <hi>Biolet,</hi> which is in the Marquiſate of <hi>Saluces,</hi> as alſo they raiſed troopes in <hi>Vaucluſon</hi> in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>running the Valley of <hi>Pragela;</hi> to the end that being bound to their owne defence, they might not be able to fauour their neighbours, the <hi>Waldenſian</hi> Churches
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:173840:69"/>in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> All this was guided by the ſingular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, in that they diuided their troopes by bands, rather out of their pride then for their bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expedition. For notwithſtanding they were all imployed in their owne defence, and could not ſuccor one another, yet the enemy by this diuiſion did ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh their forces, that they were euery where beaten, but eſpecially in the Valley of <hi>Angrongne,</hi> where they made their moſt violent aſſault. For as this leuy of men could not be raiſed, without ſome aduertiſement that it was againſt themſelues, ſo accordingly they prepared themſelues to receiue them, keeping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ſtraight paſſages, where few men were able to make any aſſault, being armed with certaine long targets of wood, that did wholly couer them, and wherein the arrowes of their enemies ſtrooke, without any hurt to themſelues: The formoſt being thus armed and couered, the reſt did good ſeruice, and with good aduantage, with their bowes and croſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes vnder the couert of the ſaid targets, and as the enemy thought to draw neere to the paſſages, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children being ſpectators, vpon their knees cried out in their owne language, <hi>O Dio aiutaci, &amp;c.</hi> O God helpe vs. Whereat the enemies making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues merry, amongſt other one Captaine <hi>Saquet,</hi> counterfeiting the ſaid women, was ſlaine, and caſt headlong from the mountaine into a deepe bottome, which to this day is called the Gulfe of <hi>Saquet.</hi> At the ſame time, a certaine Captaine named <hi>le Noir de Montdeni,</hi> cried out to the women that prayed vnto God, <hi>imiei, i miei faranno la paſſada,</hi> as much to ſay, as the ſouldiers cried out to them to put them to death, was killed with the ſhot of an arrow in the throat;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:173840:69"/>which the ſouldiers perceiuing, and that the rockes, the ſtones and the arrowes couered them, they betooke themſelues all to their heeles, and the greateſt part of them, caſt themſelues downe from the rockes. This people obſerued another effect of the prouidence of God, and that is, that the enemies approaching to the ſtrongeſt place by nature, which is the Valley of <hi>Angrongne,</hi> called <hi>le Pre de la Tour,</hi> where they might haue fortified themſelues, and made themſelues maſters of the ſaid Valley; God ſent ſo thicke a cloud, ſo darke a fogge, that the enemies could hardly ſee one another, inſomuch that they had no leaſure or meanes to know the goodnes of the place, or to ſtay there; whereupon the <hi>VValdenſes</hi> gathering courage, followed the chaſe in ſuch manner, that being all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and not ſeeing which way they went, the greateſt part fell headlong downe the mountaines, and put themſelues vnto flight, quitting themſelues of their armes and their booties, which they had gotten at their entrance in the Valley, where they had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out their wine, their corne, and loaded their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants with their moſt precious moueables.</p>
                  <p>It pleaſed God to touch the heart of their Prince with ſome compaſſion of this poore people. It was <hi>Philip</hi> the ſeuenth of that name, Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> who ſaid, that he would not haue that people, that had been alwaies true and moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient vnto him, to be rigorouſly handled by way of Armes; being contented that a doſen of the principall amongſt them, ſhould come to <hi>Pigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol,</hi> where hee was, to aske pardon for all the reſt, for that they had taken armes in their defence, which he gaue them to vnderſtand by a certaine Biſhop whom
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173840:70"/>he ſent to <hi>Praiſut;</hi> they deputed the ſaid doſen, to do whatſoeuer his Highneſſe required of them; Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them louingly, and forgaue them all that was paſt during the warre, paying a certaine ſumme of money for the charges thereof. And foraſmuch as he had been informed, that their young infants were borne with blacke throats, and that they had foure rowes of teeth, and hairy, hee commanded that ſome of them ſhould be brought to him to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> which was preſently executed, and ſeeing them all faire and perfect creatures, hee was much diſpleaſed with himſelfe, for that he was ſo eafily perſwaded to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that which was reported vnto him touching this people, declaring withall, that his pleaſure was, that from thence forward they ſhould liue with the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame liberties and prerogatiues, as in former times, and as all his other ſubiects of <hi>Piedmont</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all this, the Moneks the Inquiſitors, ſent out proces euery day, for as many of them as they could apprehend, eſpecially they kept themſelues in ambuſh in a certaine Conuent neer vnto <hi>Pignerol,</hi> from whence they deliuered them to the ſecular power. This perſecution endured to the yeere,<note place="margin">1532.</note> one thouſand fiue hundred thirty two, at what time they reſolued to order their Churches in ſuch ſort, that that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe which was before performed in couert, might be knowne of euery one, and that their Paſtors ſhould preach the Goſpell openly, that is to ſay, without any apprehenſion of perſecutions that might happen vnto them.</p>
                  <p>His Highneſſe was ſpeedily aduertiſed of this change, and much moued therewith, in ſuch ſort, that hee commanded one <hi>Pantaleon Berſor,</hi> to ſpeed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173840:70"/>himſelfe into the ſaid Valleys with his troopes of men, which hee ſo readily performed, that before the people were aware of it, hee was entred their Valleys with fiue hundred men, part on foot, and part on horſebacke, ranſaking, pillaging, and waſting what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer was before them. The people leauing their plough and tillage, put themſelues into their paſſages, and with their ſlings, charged their enemies with ſuch violence, that they were conſtrained to flie, and to abandon their prey, many of them remaining dead vpon the ground. This newes came preſently to his Highneſſe, being likewiſe told him that experience had taught them before, that it was not the way to reclaime and ſubdue theſe people by armes, the places of their habitation being ſo fauourable vnto them, they knowing better the ſtraites and paſſages of the Country, then the aſſai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nts; and therefore there was nothing to bee gotten, when the skin of one of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> muſt bee bought with the loſſe of the liues of a doſen of his other Subiects. Hee thought it therefore not good to moleſt them any more by armes; but onely that they ſhould be taken by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, one by one, as they came into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and examplary iuſtice executed vpon them, if they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not their beliefe, that ſo by little and little they might be deſtroyed, to the aſtoniſhment of all others that dwell in the ſaid Valleys, and ſo their ruine might be procured inſenſibly, and without the danger of any other the Princes Subiects.</p>
                  <p>All this hindred not, but that they ſtill perſiſted in their reſolution. And to end that all things might bee done in order amongſt them, they aſſembled themſelues together, out of all their Valleys, to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grongne</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:173840:71"/>which hath been taught them from the father to the ſonne for theſe many hundred yeeres, and taken out of the word of God.</p>
                  <p>ARTICLE I. That Diuine Seruice cannot bee done, but in ſpirit and in truth; For God is a ſpirit, and whoſoeuer will pray vnto him, muſt pray in ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. All that haue been, or ſhall be ſaued, haue been choſen of God before all worlds.</p>

                  <p n="6">VI. A Chriſtian may ſweare by the name of God, not any way contradicting that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the fift Chapter by Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> prouided, that hee that ſweareth, take not the name of the Lord in vaine. Now that man ſweareth not in vaine, whoſe oath redoundeth to the glory of God, and the good of his neighbour. Alſo, a man may ſweare in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe he that beares the office of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, be he Chriſtian or infidell, hath the power of God.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Auricular Confeſſion is not commanded of God, and it is concluded according to the holy Scriptures, that the true confeſſion of a Chriſtian conſiſteth in confeſſing himſelfe to one onely God, to whom belongs honour and glory. There is another kinde of confeſſion, which is, when as a man recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileth himſelfe vnto his neighbour, whereof mention is made in the fift of Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> The third man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

                  <p n="8">VIII. We muſt ceaſe vpon the Lords day, from all our labours, as being zealous of the honor and glory of God: for the better exerciſe of our charity towards our neighbours, and our better attendance to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the word of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. It is not lawfull for a Chriſtian to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge himſelfe vpon his enemy, in any manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. A Chriſtian may exerciſe the office of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ouer Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. There is no certaine time determined for the faſt of a Chriſtian, and it doth appeare in the word of God, that the Lord hath commanded, or appointed certaine daies.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. Marriage is not forbidden any man, of what quality or condition ſoeuer he be.</p>

                  <p n="15">XV. The miniſters of the word of God, ought not to be changed from place to place, except it be for the great benefit of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="16">XVI. It is not a thing repugnant to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall communion, that the miniſters ſhould poſſeſſe any thing in particular, to prouide for the maintenance of their families.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. Touching the matter of the Sacraments, it hath been concluded by the holy Scriptures, that we haue but two Sacramental ſignes, the which Chriſt
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:173840:72"/>Ieſus hath left vnto vs; the one is <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> the other the Euchariſt, which wee receiue to ſhew what our perſeuerance in the faith is, as wee haue promiſed when we were baptized, being little infants: As alſo in remembrance of that great benefit, which Ieſus Chriſt hath done vnto vs, when hee died for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, waſhing vs with his moſt pretious bloud.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Articles being reſolued vpon by them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed the Prieſts that were amongſt them to gather vp the reuenewes of their Cures, being out of all hope to ſee thoſe people reclaimed, and brought vnto the obedience of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by any force, much leſſe of their owne acord; and perceiuing the dore to be ſhut againſt their gaine, they retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues without ſpeaking a word.

                  <p>There happened warres in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> betweene King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that name, and the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which fell out happily for theſe poore people, for ſo long as thoſe confuſions continued, they were at quiet, vntill Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third of that name, ſollicited the Parliament of <hi>Turin</hi> to take ſome violent courſe againſt them, in doing iuſtice vpon them, as vpon pernicious Heretickes, whenſoeuer they ſhould bee deliuered into their hands by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors. This Parliament cauſed a great number to be burnt at <hi>Turin,</hi> in immitation of other Parliaments in <hi>France,</hi> who burnt in thoſe times, thoſe they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They had recourſe vnto the King, preſenting vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him their petition, that they might not be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſaid Parliament for the profeſſion of that Religion, in the which they and their anceſtors had liued for many hundred yeeres, and that by the permiſſion of their Princes. But they made it worſe with them then it was before; for the King enioyned them to liue, according to the laws of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> vpon paine to bee chaſtiſed as Heretickes. He likewiſe commanded the Court of Parliament at
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:173840:73"/>
                     <hi>Turin,</hi> to cauſe all his Subiects within their iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to profeſſe his religion; Adding withall, that he did not burne the <hi>Lutherans</hi> throughout his whole Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> to make a reſeruation of them among the Alpes.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament endeuoured ſpeedily to put the commandement of the King in execution, and for that cauſe enioyned them vpon paine of their liues, to quit themſelues preſently of their Miniſters, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue Prieſts to ſing Maſſe, liuing after the manner of other the Kings ſubiects. They anſwered, that they could not obey any ſuch commands againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, whom in what belonges vnto his ſeruice, they would rather obey then men. But had not the King at that time had other imployments elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, without all doubt this Parliament would haue made them doe that by force, which they would not be brought vnto by ſimple commands. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contented themſelues to proſecute them by the Inquiſition, and to receiue from the Monkes, thoſe they condemned to the fire. But afterwards in the yeere 1555, they increaſed the perſecution.<note place="margin">1555.</note> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing condemned to the fire, one <hi>Barthelmew Hector</hi> a Stationer, who was executed at <hi>Turin,</hi> becauſe hee died with admirable conſtancy, inſomuch that hee edified the aſſiſtants and ſtanders by, in ſuch manner, that he drew teares from their eyes, and words of compaſſion from their mouthes, iuſtifying him with a mutuall applauſe, which they gaue of his good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and prayers vnto God. The Parliament tooke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion herupon, to do their beſt endeauor to ouerthrow this profeſſion in the very ſource, and to vſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173840:74"/>of the King, to enforce this people to liue vnder the lawes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>

To this end and purpoſe, the Parliament of <hi>Turin</hi> deputed a certaine Preſident of Saint <hi>Iulian,</hi> and a Collaterall named <hi>de Eccleſia,</hi> to tranſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto thoſe places, and there to put in practice whatſoeuer they thought good, either to reduce or to exterminate the ſaid people, with promiſe to aſſiſt them, with whatſoeuer ſhall be needfull to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, according to the aduiſe and counſell they ſhould receiue from them.</p>
                  <p>This Preſident with his Collaterall, ttooke their iourney to <hi>Perouſe,</hi> and cauſed Proclamations publikly to be made in the name of the King, that euery one of the Inhabitants was to goe to Maſſe, vpon paine of his life. Afterwards, they came to <hi>Pignerol,</hi> where they cited many to appeare before them. Amongſt others, there appeared a poore ſimple labouring man, whom the Preſident commanded to cauſe his child to be re-baptized, which had lately been baptized by the miniſter of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> neere <hi>Angrongne.</hi> This poore man requeſted ſo much reſpite, as that he might pray vnto God before hee anſwered him. Which being granted with ſome laughter, he fell downe vpon his knees in the preſence of all that were there, and his prayer being ended, he ſaid to the Preſident, that hee would cauſe his childe to be re-baptiſed, vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ſaid Preſident would diſcharge him by a bill ſigned with his owne hand, of the ſinne which he ſhould commit in cauſing it to be re-baptized, and beare one day before God the puniſhment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation which ſhould befall him, taking this ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:173840:74"/>vpon him and his. Which the Preſident vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, hee commanded him out of his preſence, not preſſing him any farther.</p>
                  <p>Now hauing framed diuers indictments againſt ſome particular perſons of the ſaid Valleys, and made ſome collections of whatſoeuer the Preſident could imagine might hurt the people, hee aſſayed alſo to winne them by the preachings of the Monkes, whom he brought with him into the Valley of <hi>Angrongne.</hi> Being therefore come vnto the place where their Temple was, he cauſed one of his Monkes to preach in the preſenee of the people, who made vnto them a long exhortation to returne vnto the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of which hee reported many things which the people beleeued not. After that the Monke had ſaid as much as he would, and that he held his peace, the greateſt number of the people required, that the Paſtors that were there preſent, or ſome one of them for all, might be permitted, louingly and mildly to anſwer to the diſcourſe that had been made by the Preacher; but the Preſident by no meanes would giue way thereunto, whereupon there followed a certaine rumour or muttering among the people, which ſtrooke the Preſident and his Monkes with an aſtoniſhment, in ſuch ſort, that they could haue been content to haue been elſewhere: but diſſembling their feare, the Preſident retired himſelfe, without a word ſpeaking, to <hi>Turin,</hi> whether being come, hee related to the Parliament what hee had done, and withall ſignified vnto them the difficulties that were, to winne this people by extremities, becauſe if any attempt ſhould bee made to take them by violence, they were reſolued to defend themſelues, and the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173840:75"/>places of their abode being fauourable vnto them, it was to bee feared, it would coſt a great deale of labour, and much blood would bee ſhed, before they could either bee brought into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or out of the world. That is was the worke of a King to roote them out, and a King of <hi>Franc;</hi> and therefore it was neceſſary to ſend the reports, and to commit vnto his owne will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the iſſue of ſo troubleſome an enterpriſe. This aduice was followed, the indictments and reports were ſent to the King, but as the affaires of the Court cannot be finiſhed but with long time, there paſſed a whole yeere, before there was any other courſe ſpoken of, or taken againſt them, then that of the Inquiſitors, who alwaies deliuered ſome one or other to the ſecular power; but the yeere being expired, there came from the Court expreſſe commands of the King to make them to doe that by force, which they would not be brought vnto by words, or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſage. The Parliament re-ſent the ſaid Preſident of Saint <hi>Iulien,</hi> who ſo ſoone as hee was arriued at <hi>Angrongne,</hi> he commanded them in the name of the King to goe to the Maſſe, vpon paine of Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bodies and goods. They demanded a Copy both of his commiſſion and his ſpeech, promiſing to anſwere him in ſuch a manner, that he ſhould haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to reſt contented: but nothing could giue the Preſident ſatisfaction, who ſtill preſſed vpon them to change their religion, but in vaine. For they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, that they were not bound to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, againſt the commandement of God. Hee commanded that twelue of the pricipalln amongſt them, with all the Miniſters and Schoole-maſters
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:173840:75"/>ſhould preſently yeeld their bodies to the priſons of <hi>Turin,</hi> there to receiue ſuch ſentence as reaſon ſhall require, and hee enioyned the <hi>Sindics</hi> of the ſaid Valleys to diſmiſſe and ſuffer to depart preſently all ſtrangers, and from thence forward not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any Preachers or Schoole-maſters, but ſuch as ſhall be ſent them by the Dioceſan. They anſwered, that they could not nor would not obey any ſuch commands as were againſt God, and that they would not make their appearance at <hi>Turin,</hi> becauſe they could not doe it without danger of their liues, and to be moleſted for their beleefe.</p>
                  <p>This Parliament of <hi>Turin</hi> was in ſuch ſort incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt them, that as many as they could cauſe to be apprehended in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the frontiers of the Valleies, ſo many they burnt at <hi>Turin;</hi> among others M. <hi>Ieffrey Varnigle</hi> Miniſter at <hi>Angrongne</hi> was burnt in the yeere one thouſand fiue hundred fifty ſeuen,<note place="margin">1557.</note> by whoſe death at <hi>Turin</hi> in the place of the Caſtle, the people were much ſtrengthned and edified, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſent a great number, that ſaw him to perſiſt in the inuoucaton of the name of God vnto his laſt gaſpe.</p>
                  <p>During theſe grieuous perſecutions, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> did intercede for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, to ſuffer them to liue in peace, in the profeſſion of that Religion wherein they had liued from the father to the ſonne for ſome ages paſt. The King promiſed to haue regard to this their requeſt, and indeed they continued quiet, vntill the peace was made betweene the King of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Sauoy</hi> was

                  <p>The yeere after the ſaid reſtitution of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">1560.</note> the Popes Nuntio reproued the Duke of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> for that he followed not the ſteps of the Kings of <hi>France</hi> in his zeale, who affecting the Catholike <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> religion, had with all his power perſecuted the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> and <hi>Lutherans</hi> of the Valleys of <hi>Angrongne,</hi> and other their bordering neighbours; and that if he did not ioyne his forces in what poſſibly hee could to bring them into the boſome of the Church, or to take them out of world, that his Holineſſe ſhould haue great reaſon to ſuſpect him to bee a fauourer of them. The Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> promiſed to vſe all the meanes he could, for their reduction or vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; in purſuit whereof, hee commanded them to goe to the Maſſe, vpon paine of their liues, and to ſee their Valleys laid open to fire and ſword. To which command they not yeelding obedience, he ſet vpon them by open force, and gaue the charge of this warre, to a gentleman named <hi>le ſieur de la Trinite;</hi> And in the meane while at the ſelfeſame time he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to be purſued by the Monkes the Inquiſitors, <hi>Iacomel,</hi> and <hi>de Corbis.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">This war is printed in a treatiſe by it ſelfe. And it is likewiſe ſet downe in the 8. booke of the hiſtory the Martyrs of our times. fol. 532.</note>But foraſmuch as the Hiſtory of this warre, is brought to light elſwhere, we will not enter into any large diſcourſe thereof, onely we may here obſerue, that after <hi>la Trinite</hi> had been well beaten with his troopes, ſeeing that the Lions pawe could ſtand him in no ſteed, he couered himſelfe with the Foxes skin, telling them that what had paſſed, had befallen them for want of parley and communication, rather
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173840:76"/>then for any ill will that his Highneſſe bare vnto them; and that if his ſouldiers had exceeded their bounds, it was becauſe of that reſiſtance which they found, and that hereafter hee would bee an inſtrument for their conſeruation, and as deſirous to procure their peace, as at the beginning he ſhewed himſelfe earneſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their trouble. And therefore he counſelled them to ſend certaine of the principall amongſt them to his Highneſſe, by whom he would ſend his commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory letters, both to the Prince, and Madam <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> Ducheſſe of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> and only ſiſter to <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and that he did aſſure himſelfe that his Highneſſe would blot out the remembrance of all that was paſt: But yet he thought it neceſſary, that aboue all things they ſhould giue ſome teſtimony of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Prince; who in other places was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the Pope to eſtabliſh the Maſſe in all his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories, and therefore they ſhould permit that the Maſſe might be ſong in <hi>Angrongne,</hi> which was but a thing indifferent vnto them, ſince he did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their preſence at it, but onely that hee might write vnto his Highneſſe, that they were his good and obedient Subiects. And moreouer, to the end, that his Highneſſe might not ſtill perſiſt in his opinion, that any ſtrange miniſter did make his abode within his Prouinces, that it was in their power to intreat them, to retire themſelues vnto <hi>Pragela</hi> for ſome few daies, and that afterwards when his Highneſſe ſhould be pacified towards them, they might call them home againe. It coſt him a great deale of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to gaine thus much of them; for if we intreat our Paſtors to retire themſelues (ſay they) it will be a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the fleſh, and God will not bleſſe it; for our
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173840:77"/>enemies when they ſhall haue gotten this aduantage of vs, and that we haue no man left to comfort vs, to counſell vs, to reproue, to exhort vs, they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour no doubt to the vtmoſt of their power, euer to ſhut the gates againſt the returne of our good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, by woſe miniſtry, we haue been ſo worthily inſtructed, and fortified againſt a world of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And therefore to the end we may not be accuſed as Rebels for recalling them home againe, it ſhall bee better for vs not to depriue our ſelues at all of the fruit of their miniſtry, and from hence forward to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for ſuch in ſeruing of God, as preſerue thoſe whom he hath ſent to preach his word vnto vs. He is as powerfull to preſerue vs, as he hath been hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in times paſt, and vngratefull wretches wee are to doubt of his aſſiſtance, and not to thinke that we ſo miſerable a flocke, the dogges being chaſed away, ſhall not bee deuoured by the wolues. Thoſe and diuers the like were the ſpeeches and motions of thoſe that were moſt cleere ſighted, and more zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then the reſt, but yet this could not hinder others from intreating their Paſtors to retire themſelues for ſome few daies to <hi>Pragela,</hi> a Valley neer vnto theirs, &amp; peopled with their brethren the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Dauphine.</hi> Here a man might perceiue the heauy iuſtice of God pon them, and the beginning of miſery, euery one to melt into teares, the rockes reſounding and calamities, with cryes and lamentations, when euen women and infants, conducted their Paſtors to the high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, to paſſe ouer to the other part of them. And from other parts, when they ſaw the principall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, to take their iourney to <hi>Turin,</hi> to the middeſt of their enemies, many preſaged the euill
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173840:77"/>that would ouertake them, and it ſeemed vnto them that God had foraken them, at that time when they had forſaken him in the perſon of his ſeruants. It came to paſſe euen as it had been foretold, by thoſe that could not allow of thoſe counſels of the fleſh. For being arriued at <hi>Turin,</hi> they were preſently lockt vp in ſtrong priſons, their indictments framed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Heretickes, the paſſages garded to hinder any that might giue aduertiſement of the vſage and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment they receiued, that were deputed to this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. And in the meane time, <hi>la Trinite</hi> told them, that he knew that his Highneſſe had agreed to all that they demanded, and that he had written vnto him, that he detained them for no other cauſe, but to aſſure him of their promiſes for time to come, to which purpoſe he likewiſe raiſed a Fort which he built neere to <hi>Angrongne.</hi> Which made them to thinke hardly of their affaires, in that they could heare no newes of their poore priſoners, and much leſſe would <hi>la Trinite</hi> ſuffer them to ſend any thither. In the end, hauing a long time conſulted with themſelues what they ſhould doe, ſeeing a Fort built which might curb and bridle them for euer, if they ſhould ſuffer it to be brought to perfection; and on the other ſide, fearing if they ſhould enterpriſe any thing againſt thoſe that laboured therein, that it ſhould coſt them their liues that they ſent to <hi>Turin,</hi> they were in great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme perplexities, not knowing what courſe to take; for they found, that they had been mocked by that Prater <hi>de la Trinite,</hi> and therefore it ſtood them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to commit the euent to the prouidence of God, and to reconcile themſelues to him by prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, which when they had done, they called home
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173840:78"/>their Paſtors, implored the aſſiſtance of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Pragela,</hi> who came vnto them with their armes, entred into the Temples, wherein <hi>la Trinite</hi> had cauſed them to build Altars, and to place images, and ouerthrew the Altars, and laid them leuell with the ground, raſed vp the foundations themſelues, brake downe the images, beſieged the Fort and tooke it, killed as many as made reſiſtance, beate the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours that were ſent to the ſaid Fort, put them to flight and ſlew a great number of them. The Prince <hi>Emanuel Philibert</hi> being much offended herewith, would haue reuenged himſelfe vpon thoſe that hee kept in priſon; but Madame <hi>Margarite</hi> interceeding for them, pacified the Prince, ſhewing that is was neceſſary for them to conſult with themſelues touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that vſage and intertainment, his Highneſſe had giuen to thoſe that were deputed, and that ſeeing themſelues in the way to a totall deſtruction, they had taken this oblique meanes to relieue and to helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. His Highneſſe therefore by the aduiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation of the Popes Nuntio, had enforced the ſaid deputies to goe to the Maſſe, and there to aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of God, the Pope, and their holy mother the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with promiſe to liue according to the Lawes thereof; and afterwards ſent them to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, attending the perfection of his Fort. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe fruſtrated of his expectation, he follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the courſe propoſed by Madame <hi>Margarit,</hi> vnder which they haue liued vnto this preſent, which agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we doe not here inſert, becauſe it is elſwhere ſet downe in their Hiſtory. True it is, that afterwards they ſuffered at ſundry times, ſundry perſecutions, which they bare patiently, and with much zeale.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:173840:78"/>Among the reſt, that in the yeere 1570,<note place="margin">1570.</note> was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame. For their Prince being entred into an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue league againſt the Proteſtants, with many other Princes of Europe, he began to trouble and to vexe his ſaid Subiects of the Valleys of the <hi>Waldenſes:</hi> Firſt by forbidding them to haue any commerce with the <hi>VValdenſes</hi> of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> vpon paine of their liues; and ſecondly to aſſemble themſelues in any Synod or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, but in the preſence of the Gouernour of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrocaro;</hi> for the fulfilling whereof, he failed not to be preſent at the firſt Synode, which they called at <hi>Bobi.</hi> The Paſtors and Ancients that were there, ſignified to the ſaid Gouernour, that his aſſiſtance in their Synods was no way diſpleaſing vnto them, becauſe the matters that were to be handled, were ſuch, as if the whole world were a witnes vnto them, the more ſhould their piety towards their God appeare, and fidelity to wards their Prince, being to deliberate of nothing, but what might tend to the glory of God, and their obedience to their ſuperiours: And that foraſmuch as his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe tooke occaſion to diſtruſt them, it muſt needs be the falſe information of ſome of their enemies, and therefore aſſuring themſelues in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, that they had neuer deſerued it, they could not but take this nouelty for a manifeſt breach of the treatie and agreement he had made with them, and and a perſecution ſhaking the free exerciſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. They intreated therefore the Gouernour of <hi>Caſtrocaro,</hi> to retire himſelfe, and not to moleſt them by any ſuch innouation, and ſwarming from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer treaties, at leaſtwiſe vntill that they hauing iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelues before his Highneſſe, it might be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ordered and prouided by him. The Gouernour ſtands ſtill reſolued to ſtay there. The Paſtors and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173840:79"/>Ancients declare againſt the ſaid the nouelty; The Gouernour alſo for his part proteſteth, not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe any thing herein, but by the expreſſe comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of his Highneſſe, and that they ſhould be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter content, that he had that charge then any other, becauſe he was willing to doe them any good might lye in his hower, made a good interpretation of all their actions, and would not faile to make a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port vnto his Highneſſe of the fidelity he perceiued to be in their cariage.</p>
                  <p>He was therefore admitted into their Synode, at the end whereof, he vſed this ſubtilty, that is, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſow enuy and iealouſie amongſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, giuing good words in generall, that hee had found their order faire and good, and that he neuer had belieued, that they had proceeded with ſuch zeale, order, and charity; but yet there was no reaſon hee ſhould wonder that his Highneſſe had been iealous and diſtruſtfull of ſtrange Miniſters, becauſe he knew very well, that they were more violent in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then the home-bred of the Country, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the greateſt part; for he made exception of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Steuen Noell,</hi> whom he knew (ſaith he) to be a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, and more affectionated to the contentment of his Highneſſe; and therefore that ſince his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had reſolued not to permit any ſtranger to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite within his Lands, hee could not belieue, that Miniſters were more exempted then other men, and therefore to the end he might not be conſtrained to vſe his power and authority, to enforce them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelues out of thoſe Countries, that they ſhould doe well, if of their owne accordes, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſomewhether elſe, which would be far better
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:173840:79"/>and more honourable for them, then that they ſhould ſtay, till the Prince ſhould enforce their departure out of his Countries by baniſhmnet. They anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they could not belieue, that his Highneſſe had any ſuch meaning, as the Gouernour would ſeeme to perſwade them. But that they might bee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informed of the truth thereof, they would depute ſome amongſt them to go to his Highneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The Gouernour being much moued, that they would giue no credit to his words, nor doe any thing by his perſwaſions, ſuffered the ſouldiers of <hi>Caſtrocare,</hi> to compaſſe the temple, at what time the Preacher was in the Pulpit, and to doe diuers inſolencies, ſhooting off their gunnes, and aſtoniſhing thoſe who were diſarmed, and thought themſelues ſurpriſed. Maſter <hi>Steuen Noel</hi> was intreated to write to Madame <hi>Margarite,</hi> which he did: but the Letters by which Madame aſſured them, that the Gouernour had commandement from his Highneſſe to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe within the limits of the treaty paſſed betwixt his Highneſſe and the people, remained ſtill in the hands of the ſaid Gouernour, and in the meane time, whileſt theſe things were afoote, the Maſſacre executed in <hi>France</hi> in the yeere 1572 happened,<note place="margin">1572.</note> which in ſuch a manner puffed vp the pride, and increaſed the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the ſaid Gouernour, that there was no meanes to ſtay his violences; For the bone-fires of ioy being made throughout all <hi>Piedmont,</hi> becauſe of this effuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of bloud, this Gouernour perſwaded himſelfe, that he ſhould ſhortly ſee the like perſecution in the ſaid Valleys, and therefore the people hearing the Cannons that were ſhot off, and the great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that his Highneſſe tooke, they perſwaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173840:80"/>that they ſhould not long continue in peace, and therefore they thought their ſureſt courſe was, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey thoſe goods that were moſt precious vnto them, vnto the toppe of the Alpes, into the hollow caues whereof, they had been accuſtomed to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in troubleſome times. His Highneſſe being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, that his people were reſolued, and ready to defend themſelues, thought it not wiſdome to hazard the liues of his other ſubiects, to bring them into obedience, and ſo contented himſelfe, that hee had made them to feare; giuing command in the meane time, that whenſoeuer vpon any occaſion they came into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they ſhould bee apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and executed as Heretickes; whereof the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being aduertiſed, they ſought ſuch commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as were fit to maintaine life in <hi>Dauphine,</hi> in the Valleys of their brethren of <hi>Pragela</hi> and <hi>Valcluſon.</hi> Afterwards his Highneſſe and Madame <hi>Margarite</hi> being departed this life, <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> their ſonne and Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> hath maintained them in peace, vnder the treaty made with their ſaid High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his father and mother. Notwithſtanding the which, the Inquiſitors haue been alwaies watchfull to apprehend one or other, eſpecially to hinder them from ſpeaking of their beliefe, when they came downe into <hi>Piedmont.</hi> For in ſuch a caſe, (prouided that it appeare, that they haue held any diſcourſe) they haue alwaies condemned them for teaching ſtrange do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and ſwaruing from the agreement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is enioyned, that they broach no new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                  <p>The laſt that hath been perſecuted for this cauſe, was a certaine merchant of <hi>Lucerna,</hi> whoſe Hiſtory
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:173840:80"/>we will here inſert, becauſe by his conſtancy he did much edifie the people; &amp; that it may appeare vnto the world, that the Popes ceaſe not to ſhew how odious vnto them, the doctrine of the Goſpellis, and that if it were in their power to rule the hearts of the Kings and Princes of Europe at their pleaſure, the fires at this preſent ſhould ſtill be burning in all thoſe places where they haue any power or authority.</p>
                  <p>It was in the yeere 1601, that <hi>Barthelmew Copin</hi> a <hi>Waldenſian</hi> of the Valley of <hi>Lucerna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1601.</note> was at <hi>Aſt</hi> in <hi>Piedmont</hi> with his merchandize, at a Faire that ſhould be the next morrow, and being at table in the euening at ſupper, with diuers other Merchants, there was one that began a diſcourſe of the diuerſities of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſpake many things tending to the diſhonor of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of the Valleys of <hi>Angrongne,</hi> and their bordering neighbours. <hi>Copin</hi> hearing him to ſpeake of his brethren leſſe modeſty then became thoſe that profeſſed themſelues to bee Merchants, and of their Religion, to the diſhonour of God, hee thought it would be a fault in himſelfe, if he ſhould make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to thoſe blaſpemies that he heard: He therefore anſwered the party that held this diſcourſe, in fauour of his Religion; And what (ſaith he that had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by <hi>Copin</hi>) are you a <hi>Waldenſian?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Yea. And doe you not belieue, that God is in the Hoſte? No, ſaith <hi>Copin.</hi> Fie vpon you, replies the other, what a falſe Religion is yours? My Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (ſaith <hi>Copin</hi>) is as true, as it is true that God is God, and as I am ſure I ſhall die. The next morrow <hi>Copin</hi> was called before the Biſhop of <hi>Ast,</hi> who told him that he had been aduertiſed of certaine ſcandalous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and opinions, which but the day before hee
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173840:81"/>held in the euening at his lodging, and that hee muſt acknowledge the offence, if he would obtaine pardon, otherwiſe he would take order for his puniſhment. <hi>Copin</hi> anſwered, that he had been prouoked thereunto, and howſoeuer, he had ſaid nothing, that he would not maintaine with the danger of his owne life; that hee had ſome goods in the world, and a wife and children; but he had loſt the affection he bare vnto thoſe things, neither were they deare vnto him, to the preiudice of his conſcience: And as touching his behauiour (ſaith he) if it would pleaſe the Biſhop to enquire of the Merchants of <hi>Aſt,</hi> who all knew him, whether he were an honeſt man, they would all wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for him, that he had neuer wronged any man, In that whole time he had traded and conuerſed with them; and that being a Merchant, he was to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed for that cauſe, for which he was then in that place, that is, for trafficke, and therefore not to bee moleſted. That if Iewes and Turkes were permitted to come to Faires, and to trafficke throughout all <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> much more ſhould he be permitted who was a Chriſtian, eſpecially, ſince that in that diſcourſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion he did but anſwere to a queſtion moued vnto him, and that it was lawfull for any man to anſwere, and to giue a reaſon of his faith, to whom and in what place ſoeuer, euen by vertue of that treaty and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of the Valleys and his Highneſſe, which forbids them to broach new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but takes not from them the liberty to anſwere, to whomſoeuer ſhall aske any queſtions of them.</p>
                  <p>The Biſhop harkened not at all to theſe allegations, but gaue commandement, that he ſhould bee ſent to priſon. The morrow after, the Biſhops Secretary
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:173840:81"/>came to viſit <hi>Copin,</hi> and making great profeſſion of loue towards him, he ſaid vnto him, that hee would haue him know as from his friend, that if he did not acknowledge his fault, he would be in great danger of his life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Copin</hi> anſwered him, that his life was in the hands of God, and he would neuer deſire to preſerue it to the preiudice of his glory, and foraſmuch as he had but two or three paces to walke in his iourney to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, his hearty prayer vnto God was, that he would be pleaſed to giue him the grace, not to turne back. Some few daies after, he was examined by a Monke Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, in the preſence of the Biſhop, who tormented him a long time with ſweet and gentle perſwaſions, endeauouring to winne him by faire words, to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration of his beliefe: but <hi>Copin</hi> alwaies conuinced him by the word of God, alleadging vnto him, that if he ſhould be aſhamed of Chriſt Ieſus, or deny him before men, Chriſt would be aſhamed of him, and deny him before his Father in heauen. The Monke ended his diſputation with theſe and the like threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſpeeches; Goe thou waies thou curſed Lutheran, to all the diuels in hell; and when thou ſhalt be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by thoſe vncleane ſpirits, thou wilt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe good and holy counſels, which we haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee, to bring thee to ſaluation; but thou haddeſt rather go to hell, then to reconcile thy ſelf to our holy mother the Church. It is long agoe (ſaith <hi>Copin</hi>) that I was reconciled to our mother the Church.</p>
                  <p>After many violent incounters, they cauſed his wife and a ſonne of his to come vnto him, promiſing him liberty, and to depart with them if hee would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his fault by confeſſing it. They ſuffered his
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173840:82"/>ſaid wife and ſonne to ſup with him in priſon, which time he ſpent in exhorting them to patience, the wife for that ſhee ſhould want a husband, the childe a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yet ſhould aſſure themſelues, that God would be their father, and more then a husband; and for his owne part he was not bound to loue either wife or children more then Chriſt, &amp; that they ſhould hold it to be no ſmall happineſſe, that it hath pleaſed God to do him that honour, as to be a witneſſe vnto his truth, with the loſſe of his life, and that he hoped that God would be ſo fauourable vnto him, as to giue him ſtrength to endure all manner of torments for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He committed to the care and charge of his wife, his ſonne and his daughter which they had in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, enioyning her to bring them vp in the feare of God. He commanded his ſonne to obey his mother, for ſo he ſhould drawe downe vpon him the bleſſing of God, he prayed them to pray for him, that God would be pleaſed to ſtrengthen him againſt all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſo hauing bleſſed his ſonne, and taken leaue of his wife, they were diſmiſſed out of priſon, and he locked vp where he was before. His wife and child ſhedding fountaines of teares, and crying out in ſuch a lamentable manner, as would haue moued the hardeſt hearts to compaſſion. This good man not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with what he had ſaid vnto them by word of mouth, writ vnto her this Lettre following, the originall Copy whereof ſhee deliuered vnto vs, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſigned with the hand of the ſaid <hi>Copin,</hi> the ſuperſcription whereof was this:</p>

I know not the cauſe why this was permitted, but all things are in the hand of God, and whatſoeuer were the cauſe; I doe not thinke we-ſhall euer eate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether againe. And therefore pray vnto God to be your comforter, and put your truſt in him, who hath promiſed neuer to forſake thoſe that truſt in him. You are wiſe, and therefore gouerne our houſe in ſuch ſort, that you keepe our children</hi> Samuell <hi>and</hi> Martha <hi>in obedience, whom I command, by that authority that God hath giuen me, to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obedient vnto you, for then God will bleſſe them. For the reſt, be not grieued concerning my ſelfe, for if God haue appointed, that I am come to the end of my daies, and that it pleaſeth the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, that I ſhall render vp my ſoule, which hee
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:173840:83"/>hath long time lent me, my truſt in him is, that out of his abundant mercy, hee will receiue it into heauen, for the loue of his Sonne Christ Iuſus, by whom I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, that our ſinnes are blotted out, euen by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious death and paſſion; And I begge at his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hands, that he will accompany mee vnto the end, by the powerfull aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit. Bee alwaies carefull to pray vnto God, and to ſerue him, for ſo God will bleſſe and ſerue you. Take no care to ſend me any thing for theſe three weekes, and then you may ſend me, if you pleaſe, ſome money to pay the Iaylor, and ſome thing elſe to ſuccour me, if I liue till then. Remember alſo that which I haue often told you, that is, that God prolonged the life of King</hi> Ezechias <hi>for fifteene yeeres; but that he had prolonged mine a great deale more, for it is a long time agoe, that you haue ſeen me in a manner dead, and neuertheleſſe I am yet aliue, and I hope and hold for certaine, that hee will ſtill preſerue mee aliue, vntill my death ſhall be better for his glory and mine owne felicity, through his grace and mercy towards me.</hi>

                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Aſt</hi> was much troubled, what to determine concerning this poore man: For if he ſhould let him goe, they feared a ſcandall, and that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:173840:83"/>many would gather heart and courage, to ſpeake with a loud voice againſt the Romiſh Religion. On the other ſide, there was a clauſe in the treaty made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene his Highneſſe and the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> which clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from all offence, in theſe words. <hi>And if any queſtion ſhall bee mooued vnto them, touching their faith, being in Piedmont with other his Highneſſes Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, it ſhall be lawfull for them to anſwere, not incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereby any puniſhment reall or perſonall.</hi> Now he was asked the queſtion, and therefore to be quit from blame: But the Biſhop would not haue it ſaid, that hee had committed him to priſon vniuſtly. To the end therefore, that his death might not bee imputed vnto him, and it might not be thought, that he ſent him away abſolued, he ſent his indictment to Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eight, to vnderſtand what courſe hee ſhould take herein. It could neuer be knowne what anſwere the Biſhop had; but ſhortly after hee was found dead in priſon, not without ſome appearance, that he was ſtrangled, for feare leaſt if he ſhould haue been publickly executed, he might edifie and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the people by his confeſſion and conſtancy. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death he was condemned to be burnt, and ſo being brought out of priſon, his ſentence was read in the ſame place, and caſt into the fire. And this was the laſt of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> that is come to our knowledge, that hath been perſecuted to the death for his beliefe.</p>

Being arriued at <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> they ſaluted his Highneſſe in the name of the ſaid Prince <hi>Palatine,</hi> and deliuered their Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

This Councellor gaue him to vnderſtand, that the onely charity of their Maſter towards Chriſtians of the ſame Religion that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, had moued him to mediate for them, that his Highneſſe would bee pleaſed to ſuffer them to liue peaceably in the exerciſe of their Religion, not offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any violence to their conſciences: That he would account this benefit as done vnto himſelfe, and hee ſhould oblige vnto him all the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who likewiſe made the ſelfeſame requeſt by their mouthes. That he ſhould haue God the more fauourable, and his Subiects the more faithfull, if he did not ſhew himſelfe inexorable; That the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that haue happened in all the States of Kings and Princes, that haue indeauoured to raigne and reclaime the ſoules of their Subiects by armes, and to reduce them by violence, may make wiſe all other Princes, which were not yet come to ſuch extremities; That foraſmuch as they that haue not vſed rigorous courſes, haue won the hearts of their people to be more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto them, this meanes being in his power, they humbly beſeeched him to imitate herein the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonaire and gentle Princes.</p>
                  <p>It appeared by his Highneſſe anſwere, that he took but little pleaſure in this interceſſion, but much more by the effects that followed. For hee anſwered, that notwithſtanding that for his part he made no enquiry
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:173840:88"/>how the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany,</hi> gouerned their Subiects, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Soueraigne Prince, he was not to yeeld an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vnto any, of his courſes and reſolutions, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe he thanked the ſaid Prince, and all the reſt that were thus charitable towards him, his Eſtate, and his Subiects, as to wiſh their content and peace: but that the miſeries and calamities that haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongſt them, by the diuerſity of Religions, had made him to deſire to haue in his State but onely one, and that muſt be that which he there found, and in which he had been alwaies brought vp, for feare leſt vnder the mantle of Religion, and liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he muſt diſpute with his ſubiects as a companion, of thoſe things which by iuſt title were in his power to determine as a Maſter; as it had happened to other Princes in Europe, that in this caſe had no power to rule their Subiects as Soueragines. And that in might appeare vnto them, that he loued peace, he had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his Subiects the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> dwelling in his State in the Valleys of the Alpes, vnder an edict which he cauſed to be obſerued vnuiolably. That if without the ſaid Valleys he had in his State any itching buſie ſpirits affecting nouelties, thoſe he cauſed to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as Rebelles. That he thought, that as the ſaid Princes had compaſſion of his Subiects, that they might enioy the exerciſe of their Religion, ſo he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured himſelfe, that they would not take it in ill part, (ſo iuſt and iudicious they were) if he prouided for his ſurety, and preſeruation of his State, by puniſhing the ſeditions, that he would inquire, in conſideration of this their interceſſion, more narrowly into the eſtate of his Subiects, making profeſſion of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173840:88"/>and would giue them ſome refreſhing.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe they had ſpoken particularly of a certaine Miniſter named <hi>Giles,</hi> whom he detained loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vp in a dungeon, he cauſed him to be brought forth and placed in a chamber, and after inquiry made of what he was accuſed, that is, that he had writ to thoſe of <hi>Geneua</hi> to the preiudice of his ſeruice, he ſet him at liberty. He diſclaimed a certaine captaine of a Caſtle of the Valley <hi>Meane,</hi> for ſome thing he had done againſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of the ſaid Valley, but for the reſt, the Counſellor was hardly gone halfe his way home-ward, but the perſecution grew greater then it was before. Amongſt others, the Gouernour of the New-lands in the end of Nouember following, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with the ſound of a trumpet, that whoſoeuer would not within the ſpace of a Moneth goe to Maſſe, were to auoide the Lands and Territories of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe within that time, vpon paine of confiſcation of body and goods. Theſe poore people of the New lands, they could conuey themſelues to no place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of their liues. For in <hi>Prouence</hi> they burnt thoſe whom the Parliament of <hi>Aix</hi> called <hi>Lutherans.</hi> In the Territories of <hi>Honorat</hi> Earle of <hi>Tendes,</hi> they were deliuered into the hands of the Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. <hi>Gonſague</hi> Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> commanding for the King of <hi>France,</hi> in the Marquiſate of <hi>Saluces,</hi> put them to death. In <hi>Dauphine,</hi> as many as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Ambrun</hi> could apprehend, ſo many he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed either to rot in the dungeons, or to periſh in the Tower <hi>Brun,</hi> with cold and famine; and out of <hi>Piedmont</hi> they were baniſhed. There remained no other ſuccour but in the dead time of winter, to make their paſſage by night ouer a high mountaine almoſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:173840:89"/>inacceſſible, couered with ice and ſnow, into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Fraſsiniere,</hi> if poſſibly they could. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore betooke themſelues vnto the mountaine, about the feaſt of the Natiuity of our Lord, in the coldeſt time of all the yeere: But before they could come to the height thereof, the greateſt part of the women and children were benummed with cold, and the night ouertaking them, being in the top of the hill, they were inforced to lie vpon the ice, where a great part of them in the morning were found dead. They that eſcaped the danger, retired themſelues into the Valley of <hi>Fraſsiniere.</hi> Now after that the houſes of theſe poore people had remained for a time void of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, there was no man that would ſeiſe or take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Lands, much leſſe till and husband them, and therefore their Gouernours permitted the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes</hi> to continue there, and to tolerate them, making profeſſion of their beliefe; onely they were to depart out of the confines of the State of the Prince, for the exerciſe of their Religion. They haue re-peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled the ſaid Valley. Thus you haue heard as much as is come to our knowledge, touching their ſufferings, howſoeuer they haue been perſecuted from time to time, from the father to the ſonne, as the reſt of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> in <hi>Dauphine</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but their indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not come to our hands.</p>

In their trauaile they found in <hi>Calabria</hi> certaine waſte and vntilled land, and ill peopled, but yet very fertile, as they might well iudge, by thoſe parts neere adioyning. They therefore finding the Country fit to bring forth corne, wine, oyle of Oliues and cheſtnuts, and that there were hilles fit for the breeding and nouriſhing of cattle, and to furniſh them with fuell and timber fit for building; they came vnto the Lords of thoſe places to treate with them tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their abode in thoſe Countries. The ſaid Lords receiued them louingly, agreed to their lawes and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to the great aduantage of theſe new Inhabitants, came to an agreement with them, touching their Rentes, Tenthes, Toles, penalties, in caſe there fall out any differences or offences amongſt them; and ſo hauing aſſigned vnto them certaine quarters or parts of the Country, they returned for the moſt part of them, to aduertiſe their parents of the good aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that had happened vnto them, in a rich country, likely to abound in all temporall benedictions. They
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:173840:90"/>brought backe with them from their parents and friends, whatſoeuer it pleaſed them to beſtow vpon them, to begin their houſe-keeping; many of them married, and brought their wiues into <hi>Calabria,</hi> where they built certaine ſmall Townes and Citties, to which their owne houſes were as walles, as namely Saint <hi>Xiſt, la Garde, la Vicaricio, les Rouſſes, Argentine,</hi> Saint <hi>Vincens,</hi> and <hi>Montolieu.</hi> The Lords of the ſaid Countries thought themſelues happy, in that they had met with ſo good Subiects, as had peopled their Lands, and made them to abound with all manner of fruits; but principally becauſe they found them to be honeſt men, and of a good conſcience, yeelding vnto them all thoſe duties and honours, that they could expect from the beſt Subiects in the world. Onely their Parſons and Prieſts complained, that they liued not touching matter of religion, as other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did, they made none of their children Prieſts, nor Nunnes, they loued no chaunting, tapers, lampes, belles, no nor Maſſes for their dead. They had built certaine Temples, not adorning them with images, they went not on pilgrimage: they cauſed their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be inſtructed by certaine ſtrange and vnknown School-maſters, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they yeeld a great deale more honour then to them, paying nothing vnto them but their tithes, according to the agreement with their Lords: They doubted, that the ſaid people made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſome particular beliefe, which hindred them from mingling themſelues, &amp; ioyning in alliance with the naturall home-borne people of the Land, and that they had no good opinion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Lords of thoſe places began to feare, that if the Pope ſhould take notice, that ſo neere his Seate, there
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:173840:90"/>were a kinde of people that contemned the lawes of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, they might chance to loſe them, detained their Prieſts from complaining of theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who in euery thing elſe ſhewed themſelues to be honeſt men, ſuch as had enriched the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yea and the Prieſts themſelues, for the onely tithes which they receiued of that great abundance of fruites, which ariſe from thoſe lands, out of which in former times they receiued no profit at all, were ſuch as might very well giue them reaſon to beare with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters; That they were come to inhabit in thoſe places from far Countries, where perhaps the people were not ſo much giuen to the ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but yet ſince in the principall they were faithfull and honeſt, charitable towards the poore, and ſuch as feared God, they were very willing they might not be moleſted, by any more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enquiry into their conſciences. Theſe reaſons wrought much with thoſe that bare them ill will. For the Lords of thoſe places, ſtopped the mouthes of their murmuring neighbours, who could by no meanes draw them into any alliance with them, and who ſaw their goods, their cattell, and all that they poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bleſt after a more particular manner then other mens, that they were a temperate people, wiſe, not lewd or diſſolute, not giuen to dancing, or haunters of Tauernes, and out of whoſe mouthes, there did neuer proceed any blaſphemy; and to be briefe, liuing in a Country where the Inhabitants were giuen to all manner of wickedneſſe; they were as precious ſtones in a common ſinke, and therefore both enuied and admired, but yet alwaies maintained by their Lords, who comparing theſe ſubiects and vaſſals with others
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:173840:91"/>that they had, could not ſatiate themſelues with their praiſes. Thus were they maintained by their Lords againſt all enuy, and that maugre the Prieſts, vntill the yeere 1560,<note place="margin">1560.</note> at what time they could no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them againſt the Popes thunderbolts.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion was, becauſe they then vnderſtood, that in their Valleys of <hi>Pragela</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> there were Paſtors, that with a loud voyce did preach the Goſpell: For they had ſent to <hi>Geneua</hi> to be furniſhed with teachers, and they ſent them two, that is to ſay, <hi>Steuen Negrin,</hi> and <hi>Lewis Paſchal,</hi> who at their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall, did their beſt endeauours to eſtabliſh the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth of that name, being aduertiſed hereof, the Colledge of Cardinals was aſſembled, and preſently concluded and reſolued vpon the vtter ruine and extirpation of this people, who ſo neere the Popes Seate, durſt to plant the Religion of the <hi>Lutherans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The charge of this perſecution was giuen to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Alexandrin,</hi> a violent man, if there were euer any amongſt the Cardinals. Hee choſe two Monkes of his owne humour, to be his Informers, that is to ſay, one <hi>Valerio Maluicino,</hi> and a Dominican Monke, named <hi>Alphonſus Vrbin,</hi> who began with the Inhabitants of Saint <hi>Xiſt.</hi> Being in the place, they aſſembled the people, giuing them good ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and proteſting that their comming thither, was not any way to moleſt them, but onely louingly to aduertiſe them, that they were not to heare any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctours and teachers, then thoſe which ſhould be giuen vnto them by the Prelats of their Dioceſſe. That they knew well, that they had receiued teachers from <hi>Geneua,</hi> but by quitting themſelues of them,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:173840:91"/>and liuing hereafter according to the lawes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſhould haue no cauſe to feare any thing: but if they preſumed to keepe their ſaid teachers amongſt them, they did put themſelues in danger to loſe their liues, their goods and honours, becauſe they were to be condemned for Heretickes. And that they might the better know who they were, that had wholly forſaken the lawes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they cauſed a bell to be rung to Maſſe, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the people to goe thither; but in ſteed of going to the Maſſe, they quit themſelues of their houſes, and with their wiues and children that could follow them, they did flie into the woods, leauing onely within the Citty ſome few decrepit men and women, and little children. The Monkes diſſembled this flight, that they might the better intrap them all at once. They went to <hi>la Garde,</hi> not threatning any one of thoſe that ſtayed in Saint <hi>Xiſt.</hi> Being there, they cauſed the gates of the Towne to be locked, and the people to be aſſembled. They told them, that they of Saint <hi>Xiſt</hi> had abiured their Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone to the Maſſe, had asked pardon at Gods hands, promiſing them, if they would doe the like, that no man ſhould offer the leaſt hurt that might be. Theſe poore people thinking the Monkes had ſpoken a truth vnto them, they were content to yeeld to whatſoeuer they would haue them doe: But when they had vnderſtood, that their brethren of Saint <hi>Xiſt</hi> had refuſed to goe to Maſſe, and that they were fled into the woods, they were aſhamed of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and much diſpleaſed with their reuolt, and therefore inſtantly reſolued with themſelues, to goe with their wiues and children, to their bretheren of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173840:92"/>Saint <hi>Xiſt:</hi> but the Lord of the place <hi>Saluator Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nello</hi> would not ſuffer them to retire themſelues in ſo miſerable a manner, promiſing to defend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whomſoeuer; prouided (ſaith he) that they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelues like good <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholikes. In the meane time the Monkes ſent after thoſe of Saint <hi>Xiſt</hi> two Companies of foote-men, who ran after theſe poore people, as after wild beaſts, crying out, <hi>Amaſſa, amaſſa,</hi> that is, kill, kill. They ſlew diuers of them. But they that could get to the top of the mountaine, being on the hight of the rockes, intreated they might be heard; which being granted, they beſeeched them to haue pitty vpon them, and vpon their wiues and children; that they would call to minde, that they had inhabited in thoſe Countries, from the father to the ſonne for ſome ages, and that in all that time, there was not any that could complaine of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation; and yet neuertheleſſe, if they could not continue in their houſes, in that beliefe wherein they had liued to this preſent, if they might be permitted to betake themſelues, either by ſea or by land, to the protection of God, with their onely perſons, and ſome few commodities; and ſo retire themſelues whether it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to conduct them, they would very willingly forſake all their goods, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to fall into any idolatry, promiſing both for themſelues and all theirs, neuer to returne to their houſes againe. They beſeeched them euen for Gods cauſe, not to driue them to ſuch neceſſities, as that they muſt be enforced to defend themſelues, for if they ſhould be once out of all hope of mercy, it would be dangerous for themſelues, who had driuen them to theſe extremities. The ſouldiers were the more
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173840:92"/>ſtirred vp againſt them, and preſently made a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent aſſault vpon them, which bound theſe poore people to a iuſt defence, and ſo being aſſiſted by God, they ſlew the greateſt part of the Souldiers that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them, and put the reſt to flight. The Monkes the Inquiſitors, writ to the Vice-roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> that he ſhould ſpeedily ſendſome companies of Souldiers, to apprehend certaine Heretickes of Saint <hi>Xiſt,</hi> and <hi>la Garde,</hi> who were fled into the woods, and that in ſo doing, he ſhould doe that which was pleaſing to the Pope, and meritorious to himſelfe, if he ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the Church from ſuch contagion. The Vice-roy came himſelfe with his troupes. Being arriued at Saint <hi>Xiſt,</hi> he cauſed to be proclaimed by the ſound of a trumpet, that the place was condemned to be expoſed to fire and ſword. But in the meane time before his arriuall, the women had leaſure to returne to Saint <hi>Xiſt,</hi> whether they ran together, to ſeeke for victuall to feede their husbands and children, which were in the wood. The Viceroy cauſed it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed throughout the Realme of <hi>Naples,</hi> that all baniſhed people that would come to the warres againſt the Heretickes of Saint <hi>Xiſt,</hi> ſhould be pardoned all their offences formerly committed; whereupon great numbers gathered themſelues together, and were conducted to the woods, where the fugitiues of Saint <hi>Xiſt</hi> were, and they gaue them the chaſe in ſo rigorous a manner, that in the end, after the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diuers of theſe poore people, the reſt of them being ſore wounded, retired themſelues into the caues vpon the high rockes, where the greateſt part of them died with famine. The Monkes Inquiſitors made ſhew of much diſcontent, and that they were much
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:173840:93"/>diſpleaſed with that which had happened, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retired to <hi>Coſſence,</hi> where the <hi>Sindic</hi> of Saint <hi>Xiſt</hi> appeared before them, they wiſhed him ſpeedily to withdraw himſelfe, for feare leſt the Viceroy ſhould know of his being there, and ſo apprehend him. This brought thoſe of <hi>la Garde</hi> a ſleepe, who being cited by a publike proclamation to appeare before the ſaid Inquiſitors at <hi>Coſſence,</hi> or before the Viceroy at <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,</hi> they were eaſily perſwaded to beleeue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and faire ſpeeches of the ſaid Inquiſitors. For being arriued at <hi>Folcade,</hi> there were ſeuenty of them apprehended, and being bound, were brought to <hi>Montaud</hi> before the Inquiſitor <hi>Panza,</hi> who put them all to the racke. Amongſt others, he tormented one <hi>Steuen Charlin</hi> with ſuch violence, that his bowels brake out of his belly, and all to extort from him, this confeſſion and impoſture, that is, that they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſſembled themſelues by night to commit whoredomes, and damnable inceſtes, the candles being put out. But notwithſtanding his extreame torture, they could neuer get from him the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſo great a wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>There was another called <hi>Verminel,</hi> who with the extreame paine he endured vpon the racke, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to goe to Maſſe; The Inquiſitor thinking, that ſince the torment of the racke, had enforced him to forſake his Religion, that redoubling the violence thereof, he might draw from this feeble and tired perſon, the confeſſion of the former impoſture. And ſo cauſed him to be tormented in ſuch a manner, that many times he left him eight houres together vpon the racke, but yet could neuer get from his mouth ſo horrible a calumnie.</p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:173840:93"/>
                  <p>Another named <hi>Marcon,</hi> being ſtript ſtarke na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, was beaten with rods of iron, afterwards drawen through the ſtreets, and burnt with fire-brands. One of his ſonnes was killed with kniues, the other was brought to a high tower, where there was offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a Crucifix, with promiſe that if he would kiſſe it, his life ſhould be ſaued. He anſwered, that hee would rather die, then commit idolatry, and though he were caſt headlong from that tower, as he was threatned, yet he had rather his body ſhould be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to peeces here on earth, then by denying Chriſt and his truth, his ſoule ſhould be caſt into hell. The Inquiſitor being much enraged with this anſwere, commanded him to be caſt from the tower, to the end (ſaith he) we may ſee whether his God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him. <hi>Bernard Conte</hi> was condemned to be burnt aliue, and as he was led to the fire, he caſt to the earth a certaine Crucifix, which the Executioner had faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to his hands. The Inquiſitor hereupon comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be ſent backe to priſon, to the end his paine might be aggrauated, and ſo ſent him to <hi>Coſſence,</hi> where he cauſed him to be couered with pitch, and ſo burnt. Beſides, this Inquiſitor <hi>Panza,</hi> cut the throats of foureſcore, as a butcher doth his muttons; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he cauſed them to be diuided into foure quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and commanded that the high waies from <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tald</hi> to <hi>Chaſteau Vilar</hi> ſhould be ſet with ſtakes for the ſpace of thirty miles, and cauſed a quarter to be faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to euery ſtake; and in a place called <hi>Moran,</hi> he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be hanged and ſtrangled, foure of the principall men of <hi>la Garde,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Iames Ferner, Anthony Palomb, Peter Iacio,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Morglia,</hi> who died very conſtantly. A certaine yong man named <hi>Samſon,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:173840:94"/>defended himſelf a long time againſt thoſe, that would haue apprehended him; but in the end being woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he was taken and led to a high tower, where he was willed to confeſſe himſelfe to a Prieſt that was there preſent, before he ſhould be caſt from the tower, which he refuſed to doe, ſaying, that he had confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe to God. So the Inquiſitor commanded him to be caſt ouer. The next day the Viceroy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing below by the tower, he found this poore man languiſhing, hauing his bones broken, and imploring the mercy of God, to whom he gaue a kicke on the head with his foote, ſaying, <hi>Is this dogge yet aliue, caſt him out to the hogges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Threeſcore women of Saint <hi>Xiſt</hi> were brought to the racke, and vſed with ſuch violence, that the cordes pierced into their armes and legges; in ſuch ſort, that in their wounds there were ingendred a great quantity of wormes, which fed vpon them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aliue, they not knowing how to remedy it, vntill ſome one or other hauing compaſſion on them, gaue them ſecretly lyme, which cauſed them to fall from them. They died almoſt all miſerably in priſon. Nine of the chiefe and hanſomeſt amongſt them were loſt, and it was neuer knowne what became of them, after they were deliuered to the Fathers of the Inquiſition.</p>
                  <p>This Inquiſitor retired himſelfe to Saint <hi>Agathe,</hi> where hee deliuered a great number to the ſecular power; and if any man offered to intercede for them, he cauſed him to be put to the racke, as a fauourer of Heretickes; in ſuch ſort, that in the end there was not any that durſt to open his mouth in their behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth of that name, ſent for their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:173840:94"/>deſtruction, the Marquis of <hi>Butiane,</hi> with promiſe that if he would doe that good office to the holy Sea, as to cleere <hi>Calabria</hi> of thoſe <hi>Waldenſes</hi> that had there taken footing, he would giue vnto his ſonne a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals hat. The Marquis tooke no great paines to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute his Commiſſion, for the Monkes the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and the Viceroy of <hi>Naples</hi> had almoſt put all to death that they could apprehend, hauing ſent to the Galleys of <hi>Spaine</hi> the ſtrongeſt of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to perpetuall baniſhment the fugitiues, ſold demned to perpetuall baniſhment the fugitiues, ſold and killed woman and children.</p>
                  <p>As touching their Miniſters, <hi>Steuen Negrin</hi> was ſent to priſon at <hi>Coſſence,</hi> were he died with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: <hi>Lewis Paſchal</hi> was carried to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was condemned to be burnt aliue. Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, would needs feede his eye with this laſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of him, that had maintained him to be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, being preſent at his death with many of his Cardinals. But the Pope could haue wiſhed himſelfe elſwere, or that <hi>Paſchal</hi> had been mute, or the people deafe. For he ſpake many things againſt the Pope out of the word of God, which gaue him a great deale of diſcontent. Thus did this good man die, calling vpon God with an ardent zeale, that he much moued the ſtanders by, and made the Pope and his Cardinals to gnaſh their teeth for anger. Thus haue you ſeen the end of the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Calabria,</hi> who were wholly exterminated; For if any of the fugitiues be returned, it is vpon condition that they liue according the lawes of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>

And vpon this occaſion it was, that they of <hi>Calabria</hi> ſoiourned in in <hi>Prouence,</hi> that is, to disburden their Valleys of the great multitudes of people that were there. And though in the beginning of their arriuall in <hi>Prouence,</hi> the Country where they made their abode was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, yet they made it in few yeeres fertile and fit (by the bleſſing of God) to yeeld Corne, Wine, oyle, of Oliues, Cheſtnuts, and other fruits, and that in great aboundance.</p>

It is moſt certaine, that then the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Prouence,</hi> dwelling as it were, in the very gates of the Popes Palace, and about their Earledome of <hi>Auignon</hi> were not forgotten: But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as we haue no Copies of inſtruments, that may make good the ſaid perſecutions, we will inſert into this diſcourſe nothing but what we ſhall be able ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to proue.</p>
                  <p>The firſt perſecution is that, whereof we haue the Hiſtory in the time of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, about the yeere 1506, That is, that this good King being informed,<note place="margin">1560.</note> that there were in <hi>Prouence</hi> a certaine kind of people, that liued not according to the lawes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but were an accurſed people, committing all manner of wickedneſſe and villanies, euen ſuch, as the very memory of them ſtrooke a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into mens hearts, and the Chriſtians in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church had been vpbraided with; he gaue Commiſſion to his Court of Parliament in <hi>Prouence</hi> to take knowledge thereof, and to chaſtiſe them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merit.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173840:97"/>we teach with great inſufficiency. For that you may know at once how matters ſtand; Wee, ſuch as we are, weake inſtructers of this little flocke, haue remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for aboue foure hundred yeeres in the middeſt of ſharpe and cruell thornes, and yet in the meane time, not without the great fauour of Chriſt, as all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full can eaſily teſtifie; for this people hath many times been deliuered by the fauour and mercy of God, being gored and tormented by the ſaid thornes. And therefore we come vnto you to be counſelled and confirmed in our weakneſſe.</p>
                        <p>They writ another Letter to the ſame purpoſe, to <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> the which for breuities ſake we omit, wherein they relate, that they had addreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for the ſelfe ſame cauſe to their brethren of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, Morat,</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> which ſhewes how carefull the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> were, to ſeeke out all manner of meanes, that their vnderſtandings might be enlightned in the myſteries of piety for the ſaluation of their ſoules, eſpecially ſeeing, that then they ſought the meanes to aduance and order their Church in the open view of the world, when the fires were kindled through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>France,</hi> againſt thoſe of the ſame Religion that they were, who in thoſe times were called <hi>Lutherans:</hi> The greater therefore that their zeale was, the more they ſtirred vp their enemies againſt them, and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged themſelues into the greater dangers.

                        <head type="sub">Oecolampadius deſires the grace of God the Father, by his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, and his holy Spirit, to his well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Brethren in Chriſt, who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led VValdenſes.</head>
                        <p>WEe vnderſtand, that the feare of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath made you to diſſemble in your faith, and that you hide it. Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue with the heart to righteouſneſſe, and confeſſe with the mouth to ſaluation; but they that feare to confeſſe Chriſt before the world, ſhall not bee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by God the Father. For our God is truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſſimulation, and as he is a iealous God, he cannot endure that they that are his, ſhould ioyne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnder the yoake of Antichriſt; for there is no communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſt with Belial: And if you commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:173840:98"/>with the infidels, in going to their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maſſes, you cannot but perceiue their blaſphemies againſt the death and paſſion of Chriſt: For when they glory in themſelues, that by the meanes of ſuch ſacrifice, they ſatisfie God, for the ſinnes of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and the dead, what can follow, but that Ieſus Chriſt hath not ſufficiently ſatisfied, by the ſacrifice of his death and paſſion, and conſequently that Chriſt is not Ieſus, that is, a Sauiour, and that he died for you in vaine. If then we haue communion at this impure table, we declare our ſelues to be one body with the wicked, how irkeſome ſo euer it be vnto vs. And when we ſay Amen to their prayers, doe we not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt? What death ſhould we not rather chuſe? What paine and torment ſhould we not rather ſuffer? Nay, into what hell ought we not rather to plunge our ſelues, then to witneſſe by our preſence, that we conſent vnto the blaſphemies of the wicked. I know that your weakneſſe is great, but it is neceſſary, that they that haue learned that they are bought by the blood of Chriſt, ſhould be more couragious, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies feare him, that can caſt both body and ſoule into hell. And what ſhall it ſuffice vs, to haue a care of this life onely? ſhall that be more precious vnto vs, then that of Chriſt? And are we contented to haue taſted the delights of this world onely? Crownes are prepared for vs, and ſhall we turne backe againe? And who will beleeue, that our faith hath been true, if it faile and faint in the heat of perſecution? Let vs therefore pray vnto God to increaſe our faith. For certainly it ſhall be better for vs to die, then to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by temptations. And therefore brethren, we exhort you to diue into the bottome of this buſineſſe.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:173840:98"/>For if it to be lawfull to hide our faith vnder Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, it ſhall be likewiſe lawfull to hide it vnder the Empire of the Turke, and with <hi>Diocleſian</hi> to adore <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> nay, it had been lawfull for <hi>Tobit</hi> to adore the calfe in <hi>Bethel.</hi> And what then ſhall our faith towards God be? If we honour not God as we ſhould, and if our life be nothing but Hipocricy and diſſimulation, he will ſpew vs out of his mouth, as being neither hot nor cold. And how doe we glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our Lord in the middeſt of our tribulations, if we deny him? Brethren it is not lawfull for vs to looke backe when our hand is at the plough, neither is it lawfull to giue eare to our wiues entiſing vs to euill, that is to ſay, to our fleſh, which notwithſtanding it indure many things in this world, yet in the hauen it ſuffereth ſhipwracke.</p>
                        <p>Theſe godly admonitions preuailed much for the confirmation of the more weake, and they came in very good time for thoſe who preſently after were ſif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with many tempeſtuous outrages, and euen one of thoſe that brought the Letters made good vſe of them, that is to ſay, <hi>Peter Maſſon,</hi> who was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended at <hi>Diion,</hi> where he was condemned to death for a <hi>Lutheran.

                           <note place="margin">1540.</note> vntill that in the yeere 1540, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:173840:99"/>of <hi>Merindol</hi> were ſummoned, in the perſon of fiue or ſix of the principall, at the earneſt importunity of the Kings Atturney in the Parliament of <hi>Aix,</hi> and the ſollicitation of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Aix</hi> other Eccleſiaſticall perſons. A ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was giuen againſt them, the moſt exorbitant, cruell, and inhumane, that euer was in any Parliament, like in all things, to that edict of King <hi>Aſſuerus,</hi> granted at the inſtance of <hi>Aman,</hi> againſt the people of God, as it is written in the Hiſtory of <hi>Heſter.</hi> For beſides that, the men and women that were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned for contumacy, were condemned to be burnt aliue, by the ſaid ſentence, their children and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies outlawed, it was decreed that the place of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindol</hi> ſhould be altogether made vnhabitable, the woods cut downe, two hundred paces round about it, and all this without any audience or leaue granted to any to ſpeake a word.</p>
                        <p>The King being informed of the rigour of this Edict, ſent into <hi>Prouence</hi> the Lord <hi>du Langeai</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him of the manners and beleefe of the ſaid <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſes,</hi> and vnderſtanding that many things were laid to the charge of this people, which they were not guilty of, King <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt of that name, ſent Lettes of grace and fauour, not onely in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of thoſe that had offended by contumacy, but all the reſt of the Country of <hi>Prouence,</hi> expreſly commanding the Parliament from thence forward, not in that caſe to proceed ſo rigerouſly, as they had done in times paſt. Theſe Letters were ſuppreſt. They that were perſonally ſummoned made requeſt, that it might bee lawfull for them to anſwere by a Proctor.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Francis Chai,</hi> and <hi>William Armand</hi> appeared for all the reſt, requeſting in their names, that it might be made to appeare vnto them in what they had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that by the word of God; being ready to abiure all hereſie, if once they might know that they were fallen into any. And for this cauſe they deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them in writing, a confeſſion of their faith, to the end if they found any thing worthy reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the holy Scriptures, they might be inſtructed concerning that which they were to recant; or if they found nothing that they could reprehend, that they might be no more moleſted by ſo many and ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous perſecutions; for feare leſt thinking they made warre onely againſt men, it ſhould appeare that they made it againſt God and his truth, and thoſe that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it.</p>
                        <p>All their petitions ſerued to no other end, then to prouoke them the more; for the Iudges being poſſeſſed with an opinion, that they were Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, refuſing to take the paynes to know and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the truth, they made all their Acts in fauour of the Prieſts that accuſed them. In ſuch ſort that when the Cardinall of <hi>Tournon</hi> had obtained at a high price Letters from the King for the execution of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Decree, notwithſtanding the pardon and reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before obtained, it was executed.</p>
                        <p>This was in the yeere 1545,<note place="margin">1545.</note> that the Preſident of <hi>Opede,</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Prouence</hi> in the abſence of the Earle of <hi>Grignan,</hi> deputed for Commiſſioners, the Preſident <hi>Francis de la Fon, Honoré de Tributiis,</hi> and <hi>Bernard Badet</hi> Counſeller, and the Aduocate <hi>Guerin</hi> in the abſence of the Procurator Generall. He diſpatched ſundry Commiſſions, and proclaimed the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:173840:100"/>warre with ſound of trumpet, both at <hi>Aix,</hi> and at <hi>Marſeilles.</hi> So the troopes being leuied, and the fiue enſignes of the old bands of <hi>Piedmont</hi> ioyned with them, the army marched to <hi>Pertuis,</hi> and the next day being the fourteenth of Aprill, they went to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinet,</hi> and the ſixteenth, they began to ſet fire to the Villages of <hi>Cabrieres, Pepin, la Mothe,</hi> and Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> belonging to the Lord of <hi>Sental,</hi> then vnder age. There the poore labourers without any reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance were ſlaine, women and their daughters ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed, ſome great with childe murdered, without any mercy; The breaſts of many women were cut off, after whoſe deaths the poor infants died with famine, <hi>d'Opede</hi> hauing cauſed Proclamation to be made vpon paine of the with, that no man ſhould giue any reliefe or ſuſtenance to any of them. All things were ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked, burnt, pilled, and there were none ſaued aliue, but thoſe that were reſerued for the Galleys. The ſeuenteenth day, <hi>Opede</hi> commanded the old bands of <hi>Piedmont</hi> to draw neere, and the day following hee burnt the Villages of <hi>Lormarin, Ville Laure,</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zemines,</hi> and at the ſame time on the other ſide of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, le Rieur de la Rocque,</hi> and others of the Towne of <hi>Arles</hi> burnt <hi>Genſſon</hi> and <hi>la Roque. Opede</hi> being come to <hi>Merindol,</hi> he found not any there, but onely a yong lad called <hi>Moriſi Blanc,</hi> a very ſimple fellow, who yeelded himſelfe priſoner to a Souldier, with promiſe of two crownes for his ranſome; <hi>d'Opede</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding none other vpon whom he might wreake his anger, payed the two crownes to the Souldier, and ſo commanding him to be bound to a tree, cauſed him to be ſlaine with hargubuſe ſhot: Afterwards, he commanded the ſaid Towne to be pilled, ſacked, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:173840:100"/>vtterly razed and laid leuell with the ground, where there were aboue two hundred houſes.</p>
                        <p>There remained the Towne of <hi>Cabrieres</hi> compaſſed with walles, which were beaten with the Cannon; Theſe poore people being ſicke within, who were about ſome threeſcore boores or Peſants of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, called vnto them, that they needed not to ſpend ſo much powder and paines to batter the Walles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ready to open the gates vnto them, and to quit themſelues of the place and Country, and to depart to <hi>Geneua,</hi> or into <hi>Germany</hi> with their wiues and children, leauing all their goods behind them, onely that their paſſage might be free.</p>
                        <p>The Lord of <hi>Cabrieres</hi> treated for them, that their cauſe might be determined by iuſtice, without force or violence: But <hi>Opede</hi> being within the Town, he commanded the men to be brought into a field, and to be cut in peeces with ſwords, theſe valiant executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſtriuing who could ſhew the beſt manhood in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off heads, armes, and legges. He cauſed the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be locked vp in a barne full of ſtraw, and ſo put fire vnto it, where were burnt many women great with childe. Wherewith a Souldier being moued to compaſſion, hauing made an ouerture for them, they were beaten backe into the fire with pikes and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds. The reſt of theſe men, that were found hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the caues, were brought into the Hall of the Caſtle, where they were horribly maſſacred in the preſence of the ſaid <hi>Opede.</hi> As for the women and children, that were found in the Temple, they were expoſed to the chiefe Bauds and Ruffians of <hi>Anignon,</hi> who ſlew about eight hundred perſons, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of age or ſexe. About the end of this exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:173840:101"/>
                           <hi>le Sieur de la Coſte,</hi> kinſman to <hi>Opede,</hi> came thither, who intreated him to ſend him ſome men of warre, offering to bring all his ſouldiers into <hi>Aix,</hi> and to make as many breaches in the wall as hee would; which was granted by word of mouth, but not wholly performed. For three En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes of foot men were ſent thither, who pillaged whatſoeuer ſeemed good vnto them, burnt a part of the Towne, rauiſhed women and their daughters, and killed ſome Boores, not finding any reſiſtance. In this meane time the reſt of thoſe of <hi>Merindol</hi> and other places, were in great extremities in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and rockes, perſecuted by <hi>Opede</hi> and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. They intreated him, that hee would permit them to retire themſelues to Geneua, with the reſt of their wiues and children, promiſing to leaue behind them all their goods. Hee anſwered, that hee would ſend them all to dwell in the Country of hell, with all the diuels, them, their wiues and children, in ſuch a manner, that there ſhould be no memory left of them.</p>
                        <p>King <hi>Francis</hi> being aduertiſed of thoſe cruelties that were executed in purſuit of the ſaid arreſt, was much diſpleaſed therewith, in ſuch ſort, that at the very point of death, being wounded with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience, principally becauſe it had all paſſed vnder his name and authority, being ſorry becauſe hee could inflict no puniſhment vpon them before his death, that had ſhed ſo much innocent blood, hee gaue in charge to his ſonne <hi>Henry</hi> to bee reuenged on them, in proſecution whereof, after the deceaſe of his father, hee ſent out his Letters Patents in the yeere one thouſand fiue hundred forty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:173840:101"/>nine, by which hee tooke vnto himſelfe and into his owne hands, the cauſe of the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence:</hi> but there was none but the Aduocate <hi>Guerin</hi> that was hanged, becauſe hee had falſty informed the King, when hee kept backe the reuocation of the firſt retention of the cauſe of thoſe of <hi>Merindoll,</hi> whereupon preſently followed the execution of the Arreſt of the Court of Parliament of <hi>Aix.</hi> And all the reſt that were faulty, eſcaped vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, that it was to no purpoſe to attempt any more againſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> at that time.</p>
                        <p>Touching the reſt that eſcaped this maſſacre, ſome there were that retired themſelues to <hi>Geneua,</hi> others into <hi>Switzerland,</hi> others into <hi>Germany,</hi> and others continued neere thereabouts, tilling their land by ſtealth; and ſo by little and little, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home to their old habitations, which they built and repaired at ſuch times as they could by the benefit of the aforeſaid Edicts; and were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the ſeed of many goodly Churches, which at this day are gathered together, flouriſhing in all piety and zeale, as other Churches in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>It contented the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> very much, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that there were in <hi>Bohemia</hi> a number of people, that had giuen vnto God the glory, and remoued from them the abuſe and idolatries of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> exhorting them in the name of God, to continue in that which they had ſo wel begun, for the knowledge and maintenance of the truth, and for the eſtabiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a good diſcipline; and in witneſſe of the great ioy they receiued, and that holy Society and Communion, that they deſired to haue with them, they bleſſed them in praying for them, and laying their hands vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards the ſaid <hi>Waldenſes</hi> related vnto them, how God had miraculouſly preſerued them, for theſe many hundred yeers, notwithſtanding the diuers great and continuall perſecutions which they had endured; And ſo they louingly and gently tooke their leaue of their ſaid brethren, and at their returne related what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they had ſeen or done in that their voyage, from whence they receiued vnſpeakable content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and from that time forward, there continued

                  <p>When there came newes (ſaith he) to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, that in his Prouince of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> the traiterous Hereſie was ſpread abroad, not onely amongſt the poore, but Earles, Barons and Knights; he ſent the Abbot of <hi>Ciſteaux,</hi> and two Monkes with him, to preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe diſloyall buggerers.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173840:117"/>did there. He anſwered that the Pope had ſent him thither, againſt thoſe Sodomites, but that he could not conuert them. This good man was nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonied at it, but he ſtill maintained the worke of the Lord valiantly, and went on foot to giue good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to others, and they ſtayed and went on foot with him. Afterwards the Abbot returned to the Chapter, or generall aſſembly, but the Biſhop and the two Monkes, paſſing a long time through the Countrey and preaching, they conuerted many of the meaner ſort of people, but of the great ones and richer ſort, there were few or none, that returned to the true faith.</p>
                  <p>The Abbot came backe into the Countrey, and brought with him another Abbot, and diuers Monkes, and came all on foot; whereupon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Ceſtre</hi> began to thinke with himſelfe how to returne into his Countrey, but dyed by the way.</p>
                  <p>The Monkes who preached throughout the Countrey, found the Princes ſo obdurate in their malice, that they reſolued to ſtay no longer there, but returned into their Countries, except one good man, who was called Frier <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Chaſteauneuf,</hi> who continued preaching with one of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> knew the intention of the Pope, which was, to pretend that he was not the cauſe, why they whom he iudged to be wanderers, did not returne to the boſome of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meanes, and force of reaſon, they began to thinke that it ſtood them vpon to maintaine their beleefe by ſuch conference, otherwiſe they ſhould giue occaſion to the aduerſaries to thinke, that there was in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173840:117"/>ſome weakneſſe, if there were not any Paſtor that would take vpon him the defence thereof.

For <hi>Arnold</hi> had brought them to the onely Canon, which they pretended to be the beſt part of their Maſſe, touching which point he proued, That the holy Supper of our Lord was not the Maſſe. For if the Maſſe were the holy Supper inſtituted by our Sauiour, there would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine after the Conſecration all that which was in the Supper of the Lord, that is to ſay, Bread: but in the Maſſe there is no bread; for by Tranſubſtantiation the bread is vaniſhed away; therefore the Maſſe (ſaith he) without bread, is not the holy Supper of the Lord, for there is bread.</p>

There was now a neceſſitie either of oppoſing violence againſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or to come to ſubmiſſions. The latter was thought the more eaſie, but yet dangerous. For to yeeld himſelfe to the diſcretion of his enemies, was to bring himſelfe into the danger of his owne ruine. The Count <hi>Remond</hi> therefore came to <hi>Valence,</hi> before the Popes Legat named <hi>Milo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Being entred the toile, he began to excuſe himſelfe, ſaying: That it ſeemed ſtrange vnto him, that ſo great a number of men ſhould come in armes againſt him, that vſed no other armes to defend himſelfe, than his owne innocencie; that hee was much wronged by thoſe that perſwaded the people that hee was guiltie of the death of the Monke Frier <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Caſteauneuf;</hi> that before they had thus moued Heauen and Earth, as it were, they ſhould haue enquired of the truth of the fact, and not condemne any before he were heard:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:173840:121"/>That he had there many witneſſes of the death of the ſaid Monke, ſlaine at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Giles,</hi> by a certaine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whom the ſaid Monke purſued, who preſently retired himſelfe to his friends at <hi>Beaucaire:</hi> That this murder was very diſpleaſing vnto him, and therefore he had done what lay in his power, to apprehend him, and to chaſtiſe him, but that hee eſcaped his hands: That had it beene true which they laid to his charge, that hee had embrewed his hands in that bloud, yet the ordinary courſes of iuſtice were to be taken againſt him, and not to haue wrecked their anger vpon his ſubiects that were innocent in this caſe. And therefore (ſaith he) to the ſaid Legat, foraſmuch as vpon an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured truſt and confidence, armed onely with the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of a good Conſcience, I am come to yeeld my ſelfe vnto your hands, what need is there any more of the imployment of theſe Pilgrims or wandering peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, againſt him whom they had in their owne power? That it was promiſed him, that when his honeſtie ſhould bee knowne, they that were in armes to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, would defend him: And therefore he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreated the ſaid Legat, to ſend a Countermand to his Souldiers before they approched any further into his lands and territories, promiſing to iuſtifie himſelfe of whatſoeuer was laid to his charge, in ſuch a manner, that the Pope and the Church ſhould reſt contented: That his owne perſon might ſerue for a ſufficient pledge for the performance of theſe his promiſes.</p>
                  <p>The Legat anſwered that the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> had done well in preſenting himſelfe before him, and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him of his innocencie, whereof he would aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe his Holineſſe, and become an Interceſſor for him; but yet the buſineſſe was of ſuch an importance, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:173840:122"/>he durſt not rely onely vpon his owne knowledge, much leſſe ſend backe his Souldiers of the Croſſe, that had coſt ſo much labour, and loſt the gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, except hee would giue ſuch aſſurances of his words, as might take away from the Pope and the Church, all ſhew or ſhadow that hee may hereafter deale falſely with them that put their truſt in him. And therefore hee ſhould not thinke it a difficult matter to deliuer into his hands, ſeuen of the beſt Caſtles he had in <hi>Prouence</hi> (that is to ſay, in the Count <hi>Veneſsin,</hi> which was then annexed vnto <hi>Prouence</hi>) which ſhould ſerue for an Hoſtage.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> knew well the error he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, by putting himſelfe vnder the hatches, but it was too late to bee readuiſed, becauſe the counſels which the Legat gaue him, were as commands. Hee knew himſelfe to be a priſoner, and that hee muſt now receiue the Law of him, into whoſe power he had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſely caſt himſelfe; and therefore he made a ſhew of great willingneſſe to obey to whatſoeuer was preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Legat, acknowledging that both his perſon and his proceſſions were at the ſeruice of his holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, onely beſeeching the Legat, that his ſubiects might receiue no more damage by the Souldiers.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:173840:122"/>Pope, for proofe of his fidelitie to the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were to be aduertiſed, to the end likewiſe that they from thence forward, ſhould acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bee the lawfull ſubiects of his Holineſſe, in caſe the ſaid Earle <hi>Remond</hi> ſhould doe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the oath of obedience which hee had made to the Pope and to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which caſe, as already in thoſe times they were diſcharged of all oaths of fidelitie giuen in times paſt to the ſaid Earle, and his lands were confiſcated to the Pope. The Conſuls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much aſtoniſhed to ſee their Lord thus ſtript of all his lands and poſſeſſions, could not refuſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of himſelfe, to doe whatſoeuer the ſaid Legat required at their hands. But that which did afflict them moſt, was, that they ſaw the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> conducted to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Giles,</hi> where he was reconciled to the Pope, and to the Church, with theſe ceremonies that follow. Firſt, the Legat commanded the ſaid Earle <hi>Remond</hi> to ſtrip himſelfe ſtarke naked, without the Church of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Giles,</hi> hauing onely to couer his nakedneſſe, a cloſe paire of linnen breeches, the reſt was all bare, head, feet, and ſhoulders. Then he put a Stole (which Prieſts weare about their necks) vpon his necke, and leading him by the ſaid Stole, hee made him to goe nine times about the graue of the deceaſed Frier <hi>Peter de Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf,</hi> who had beene buried in the ſaid Church, ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with rods, which the Legat had in his hand, as long as hee went about the ſaid Sepulcher. The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> demanded ſatisfaction for this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary penance, for a ſinne which he had not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for he had not killed the Monke: The Legat an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, That notwithſtanding hee had not killed him, nor cauſed him to be killed, yet foraſmuch as this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173840:123"/>murder was committed, within his territories, and hee had made no purſuit after the murderer, this murder was deſeruedly imputed vnto him, and therefore that hee was to ſatisfie the Pope and the Church by this his humble repentance, if hee deſired to be reconciled to the one and to the other. It was therefore neceſſary he ſhould likewiſe bee ſcourged in the preſence of the Earles,<note place="margin">

In this extremitie and anguiſh of ſpirit, hee choſe rather to ſtay in the Armie for certaine daies, and afterward tooke his leaue of the Legat, and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> to humble himſelfe before the Pope, which could not bee denied him. In the meane time they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173840:124"/>made an approch to the Citie of <hi>Beziers,</hi> the Rammes, Slings, Frames, Shedbords, and other engines of warre were prouided to giue a generall eſcalado, ſetting to the walls of the Citie ſo great a number of Ladders, that it was impoſſible to reſiſt the furious aſſault which the <hi>Pelerins</hi> made with all the force and power that they had.</p>
                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Beziers</hi> went forth of the Citie, and caſt himſelfe downe at the feet of the Legat <hi>Milon,</hi> cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning mercie for his Citie of <hi>Beziers,</hi> and humbly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching him not to inflict the ſame puniſhment vpon the innocent and the nocent, which without all doubt muſt needes come to paſſe, if <hi>Beziers</hi> ſhould be taken by force (which was eaſie to be done by ſo great, and ſo puiſſant an Armie, ſuch as was then ready to ſcale the walles in euery part of the ſaid Citie) that there would be great effuſion of bloud on both ſides, which might be auoided: That there were within <hi>Beziers</hi> a great number of good Romiſh Catholikes that would be ſubiect to the ſame ruine, contrary to the intention of the Pope, whoſe deſire was onely to chaſtiſe the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes:</hi> That if it pleaſed him not to ſpare his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects for the loue of themſelues, that he would yet haue regard vnto him, to his age and profeſſion, ſince the loſſe would light vpon himſelfe, being in his minoritie, and a moſt obedient ſeruant to the Pope, as hauing beene brought vp in the Romiſh Church, and in which he would both liue and die. And if hee tooke it ill that ſuch perſons as were enemies to the Pope, had beene tolerated within his territories, it ought not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted vnto him, becauſe hee had no other ſubiects but thoſe which his deceaſed father had left vnto him; and that in his minoritie, and afterwards in that little time
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:173840:124"/>wherein he had beene maſter of his owne goods, hee could not as yet, by reaſon of his incapacitie know this euill, nor miniſter the remedy, though it were his purpoſe ſo to doe; but yet his hope was in time to come, to giue all contentment that might be, both to the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as an obedient ſonne both of the one and of the other.</p>

                  <p>The Earle of <hi>Beziers</hi> returned into the Citie, and aſſembled the people together, giuing them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that after he had ſubmitted himſelfe to the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, hee mediated for them, not being able to obtaine any otherthing at his hands, but pardon, vpon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they that made profeſſion of the beleefe of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> ſhould come and abiure their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and promiſe to liue according to the Lawes of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Romiſh Catholikes intreated them to yeeld to this ſo great a violence, and not to be the cauſe of their death, ſince the Legat was reſolued not to pardon any, if they liued not all vnder one and the ſame Law.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Albingenſes</hi> anſwered, That they would not forſake their Religion for the baſe price of this fraile life; That they knew well that God was able to defend them, if it pleaſed him, and that if he would bee glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the confeſſion of their ſaith, it ſhould bee a great honour to them to die for righteouſneſſe ſake; That they had rather diſpleaſe the Pope, who could deſtroy their bodies onely, than God who could caſt both body and ſoule into Hell fire: That they would neuer be aſhamed, or deny that Religion, by which they haue beene taught to know Chriſt and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:173840:125"/>or with the danger of an eternall death, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a Religion which doth annihillate the merit of Chriſt, and burieth his righteouſneſſe; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would couenant for themſelues as they could, and promiſe nothing contrary to the duty of true Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>This being vnderſtood, the Romiſh Catholikes ſent their Biſhop to the Legat, humbly to intreat him, that he would not include in this chaſtiſement of the <hi>Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> thoſe that were alwayes obedient to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of whom he that was their Biſhop had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge, being likewiſe aſſured that the reſt were not altogether paſt hope of repentance, but that they might be wonne by gentle meanes, beſt befitting the Church, which tooke no pleaſure in the effuſion of bloud.</p>
                  <p>The Legat herewith grew into extreme choller and paſſion, ſwearing and proteſting with horrible threats, that if all they that were in the Citie did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their fault, and ſubmit themſelues to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they ſhould all taſte of one cup, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of Catholike, ſex, or age, they ſhould all be expoſed to fire and ſword. And incontinently he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that the Citie ſhould bee ſummoned to yeeld it ſelfe to his diſcretion; which they refuſing to doe, hee cauſed all his engins of warre to play, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an aſſault and generall eſcalado to bee made. Now it was impoſſible for thoſe that were within, to reſiſt ſo great a violence, in ſuch ſort,<note place="margin">The Treaſure of Hiſt. in the taking of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers <hi>Paul Aemil. pag.</hi> 517.</note> that being thus aſſaulted, by aboue a hundred thouſand <hi>Pelerins,</hi> in the end (ſaith the Compiler of the Treaſure of Hiſtories) they within vere vanquiſhed, and the enemie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred ſlew a great multitude, and afterwards

                  <p>The Citie being taken, the Prieſts, Monkes, and Clerkes came forth of the great Church of <hi>Beziers,</hi> called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Nazari,</hi> with the Banner, the Croſſes, their holy-water, bare headed, attired with the ornaments of the Church, and ſinging, <hi>Te Deum laudamus,</hi> as a ſigne of ioy that the Towne was taken, and purged of the <hi>Albingenſes.</hi> The Souldiers who had receiued com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the Legat to kill all, ranne in vpon them, brake the order of their proceſſion, made the heads and armes of the Prieſts to flie about, ſtriuing who ſhould doe beſt, in ſuch a manner, that they were all cut in pieces. To excuſe this crueltie, diſallowed by ſome of thoſe that were ſpectators, they haue inſerted into the Hiſtorie theſe reports; that is to ſay, That the <hi>Pelerins</hi> were incenſed againſt the inhabitants of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers,</hi> becauſe they had caſt ouer the walls of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the booke of the Goſpels, crying vnto them, See there the Law of your God; whereupon the Souldiers grew to this reſolution, to kill all thoſe they ſhould find within the circuit of <hi>Beziers,</hi> that ſo they might be ſure not to ſpare thoſe that had thus blaſphemed. But how could the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> doe any ſuch thing ſo impious againſt the Goſpell of our bleſſed Sauiour, conſidering that one of the principall cauſes for which they had forſaken the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was becauſe the Goſpel of Chriſt Ieſus, was, as it were buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, &amp; the people forbid to reade it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides one of the great crimes, which they laid to the charge of the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> was, becauſe hee carried alwayes about him the New Teſtament. To this they added a miracle, and that was, that <hi>Beziers</hi> was taken vpon the day of <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> becauſe (ſay they)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173840:126"/>heretikes ſpeake ill of <hi>Magdalin</hi> in their law:<note place="margin">The Treaſure of hiſt. in the taking of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers.

                  <p>The ſituation of <hi>Carcaſſonne</hi> is in this manner. There is a city, and a Bourrough or towne. The city is ſeated vpon a little hill, enuironed with a double wall: the towne is in the plaine, diſtant from the citie about two miles. At that time the city was accounted a place of great ſtrength; and in this city there dwelt a great number of <hi>Albingenſes.</hi> The Pilgrims thought to haue taken it at the firſt ſight, for they ran with

                  <p>The <hi>Albingenſes</hi> being much animated by the ſpeech of this young Lord, ſwore vnto him, that they would ſpend their goods and their liues, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the citie of <hi>Carcaſſonne,</hi> and whatſoener did concerne the ſaid Lord. The next morrow the Legat commanded an aſſauit, and generall eſcaindo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:173840:127"/>to bee made vpon the Borough of <hi>Carcaſſonne.</hi> The people that were within, very valiantly defended themſelues; but the ladders were ſo charged with men, and ſo neere the one to the other that they tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched one another, inſomuch that they forced thoſe within from the walls, and ſo entred the towne, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying themſelues towards the inhabitants thereof, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner as they had dodne before to thoſe of <hi>Beziers;</hi> for they put them all to the ſword and fire.</p>
                  <p>Whileſt thoſe things were in doing, and king of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> arriued at the army of the Legat; and were firſt to the rent of the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> who was conſtrained to giue his aſſiſtance at this ſiege againſt his owne Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew.

                  <p>The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> returned to the Legat, who aſſembled together diuers of his great Lords and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,

                  <p>The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> retired himſelfe, not without ſhew of the great diſcontent he receiued by this vniuſt proceeding. The Legat hereupon commanded all his engins of warre to play, and that they ſhould take the Citie by force. But it was a ſpectacle little pleaſing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, for hee was an eye-witneſſe of the loſſe of a great number of his <hi>Pelerins.</hi> For they of the Citie threw downe ſuch a quantitie of great ſtones, with fire, and pitch, and brimſtone, and boyling water, and gauled the aſſaylants with ſuch infinite numbers of arrowes, that the earth was couered, and the ditches filled with the dead bodies of the <hi>Pelerins,</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a wonderfull noyſome ſtench, both in the Camp and in the Citie.

                  <p>The Legat being much troubled to ſee his company reduced to ſo ſmall a number, and being without hope to take that place ſo important to harbour him, that hereafer ſhould haue the conduct of the Armie of the Church; he bethought himſelfe of a ſtratagem, which he effected, and it was this: He ſent for a certaine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman well-ſpoken, that was in the Armie, telling him that it was in his power to doe a notable peece of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to the Church, whereby beſides the reward hee ſhould receiue in Heauen, he ſhould in this life bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced according to his merit.

                  <p>This Gentleman played his part ſo well, that hee brought with him the ſaid Earle of <hi>Beziers,</hi> to ſpeake
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173840:130"/>with the Legat, where the young Earle told him, that if hee would bee pleaſed to carry himſelfe with greater mildneſſe towards his ſubiects, hee might eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime them as he would himſelfe, and winne the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes</hi> to the Church; that the compoſition which was offered them, was diſhonorable, and ill-befitting thoſe that were to haue their eyes as chaſte as their thoughts, and that his people would rather chooſe to dye, than to be brought to ſo great a ſhame; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee humbly intreated him to bee more mercifull vnto them, promiſing to perſwade his ſubiects to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any other condition more tollerable.</p>
                  <p>The anſwer of the Legat was: That they of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſonne</hi> might determine with themſelues, as they thought beſt, and that he in the meane time ſhould take no care for them, for hee was now his priſoner vntill <hi>Carcaſſonne</hi> were taken, and his ſubiects had better learnt their duty.</p>
                  <p>The Earle being much aſtoniſhed hereat, proteſted and auerred that he was betrayed, and faith was viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that hee was come thither vpon the word of a Gentleman, giuen with oathes &amp; execrations, that he would conduct him backe ſafe and ſound into the City of <hi>Carcaſſonne,</hi> But being demanded who and where that Gentleman was, this yong Earle was taught that it was no wiſedome to leaue his Citie, vpon the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of ſimple words onely.

                  <p>The inhabitants of <hi>Carcaſſonne</hi> hauing vnderſtood of the impriſonment of their Lord, brake out into teares, and were ſtrucken with ſtrange aſtoniſhments, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they now thought of nothing ſo much, as how to eſcape the danger they were in; but all meanes

The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> added hereunto that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of any ſo vniuſt a vſurpation, for if this war were made to take away the goods and liues of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſens,</hi> by what title had the Legat confiſcated the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:173840:133"/>goods of the Earle of <hi>Beziers,</hi> who had alwaies liued, and alſo died in the beleefe of the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> That he therefore perceiued, that the greateſt crime they could finde in the ſaid Earle, was, that they found him to be young, and no way powerfull. That if God gaue him life, he would make it appeare, that he loued the Earle of <hi>Beziers,</hi> and that he was his Kinſman, and would likewiſe ſhew himſelfe a true friend, to thoſe that had any feeling of thoſe wrongs and outrages that were offered him.

                  </p>
                  <p>This clauſe gaue authority againe to the Legats, to heare the ſaid Earle, touching the aforeſaid buſineſſe, which was to bring him backe againe to the beginning of all his miſery. The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> preſſed the Legat to proceed in the fact of the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> either to abſolue, or to condemne him, to the end he might know, whether he ſhould hold him for a friend or for an enemie of the Pope and of the Church, to be at peace with him, or to make war againſt him.</p>
                  <p>The Legat <hi>Milon</hi> commanded him to appeare in his owne perſon, becauſe he would know once for all,<note place="margin">Chaſſ. lib. <hi>3.</hi> pag. <hi>129.</hi>
                     </note> how he and his ſubiects liued with them, that is to ſay, with the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> and the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> anſwered, that neither he nor his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:173840:137"/>Subiects had any thing to doe with them, that he had made his agreement and reconciliation with the Pope, which the Legat could not be ignorant of, to whom he had ſhewed the <hi>Bulles,</hi> and therefore hee intreated them to forbeare any farther to diſquiet him, The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> and the Legat writ vnto him againe, that it was very neceſſary, that he ſhould make repaire vnto him to fulfill the contents of the <hi>Bulles.</hi> He anſwered that he had rather take the paines to goe to king <hi>Philip</hi> of France, and to the Emperor, yea to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Pope himſelfe, to complaine of the wronges they did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, than to put himſelfe any more into their hands.</p>
                  <p>When the Legat ſaw that he could not winne him by Letters, he reſolued to play the fox and to winne him by ſubtleties. They ſent vnto him <hi>Folquet</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> and inſtructed him how hee ſhould cary himſelfe to deceiue him: This was a capable inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the premeditated treaſon. He went therefore to the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> inſinuated himſelfe into his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, with fained proteſtations of his deſire to ſerue him, and his great griefe to ſee ſo little loue betwixt the Legat and himſelfe, wiſhing that it were in his power to ſtand him in any ſteed therein, though with the loſſe of his owne bloud, and offering vnto him all loue and aſſiſtance: That he had far greater reaſon to procure the preſeruation of his good, than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon whatſoeuer: That he would aduiſe him as a friend, to take from the Legat all pretence of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpition: That when he had once ſhewed himſelfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of him, they would no longer doubt of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie; and that euen now a faire occaſion was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, to binde the Legat and the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> vnto him,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:173840:137"/>and that was, that whereas he knew they were ſhortly to come to <hi>Toulouze,</hi> if he would offer vnto them his Caſtle <hi>Narbonnes</hi> to lodge in, it would be an excellent teſtimony of that confidence hee had in them and binde them to loue him. The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> being thus guiled by this Biſhop, offered them his caſtle: They accepted thereof, and preſently placed therein a great garriſon. The word was no ſooner ſlipt the Earles mouth, but he was ſure he ſhould repent it, but it was now too late to recall it. He curſed his owne impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and his friends and ſubiects, his too great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility; for he ſaw them incontinently to fortifie his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that it might ſerue them for a caneſſon and bridle for his owne ſubiects: As alſo from the time of their entrance into that place, he found that they grew bold to ſpeake all the ill they could of the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> and that with open mouth; ſaying that he had mocked the Pope, giuing him to vnderſtand that which was falſe, and promiſing that which he would neuer performe, inſomuch that he was as great an heretike as he was before his abiuration.</p>
                  <p>That in the ruine and puniſhment of the Earle <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> the deſtruction of the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> did conſiſt: but on the contrary, though the ground were couered with the dead bodies of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> if the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> ſhould remaine, they would alwaies bud and ſpring vp againe, and therefore it was reſolued to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and vtterly to deſtroy the houſe of <hi>Remond</hi> from the bottome to the top. But when men purpoſe that which God hath otherwiſe diſpoſed, they come many times ſhort; So it was with the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> who was fruſtrated of this hope, by the ſudden vnexpected death of the Legat <hi>Milon,</hi> which changed the face of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:173840:138"/>the affaires of the ſaid Earle <hi>Milon:</hi> for he was faine to ſpend many yeares in the ruinating of that houſe of the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> and his adherents, which hee had promiſed to doe in a few daies.</p>

                  <p>The Biſhop of <hi>Toulouze</hi> knowing hee was excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, ſent one to certifie vnto him, that hee was to depart out of the citie of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> ſo long as the Maſſe was ſinging, becauſe he might not ſay Maſſe, there being an excommunicated perſon within the citie.

In this equipage they arriued at the Armie of the Legat, where they were receiued as Martyrs perſecuted for the Maſſe, euen with teares of the Pilgrims, and the generall applauſe of euery one.</p>
                  <p>The Legat thought now that he had ſufficient cauſe to proſecute the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> as a relapſe and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent man, but yet he deſired much to get hold of him, becauſe if he could once apprehend him, hee would quickly make him to conclude that buſineſſe as the Earle of <hi>Beziers</hi> did.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:173840:139"/>to be proſecuted as rebells to the Church. Some friend of the Earles vſed the meanes, to giue him a ſight of the Articles of the Sentence, which the Legat had a purpoſe to publiſh againſt the ſaid Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> which were theſe that follow.</p>

                     <item>That no man within his lands, noble or ignoble, ſhall weare any apparell of great price, but blacke and courſe clokes.</item>
                     <item>That all the ſtrong places and caſtles of defence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing vnto him, ſhall be ouerthrowne and laid euen with the ground.</item>
                     <item>That no Gentleman of his ſhall remaine or dwell in any City or Caſtle, but ſhall make his abode, in the fields and countrey houſes, as a villager.</item>
                     <item>That he ſhall not leuy in his lands any tolles, but thoſe that haue beene of old time impoſed.</item>
                     <item>That euery maſter of an houſe, ſhall pay yearely to the Legat foure <hi>Toulouzian</hi> pence.</item>
                     <item>That when the Earle of <hi>Montford,</hi> or any of his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173840:139"/>people ſhall paſſe through his countries, they ſhall pay nothing for any thing they take or ſpend.</item>
                     <item>That hauing performed all things, as aboue, he ſhall trauell beyond the Seas, to make warre againſt the <hi>Turkes,</hi> neuer returning againe into theſe parts, but by the commandement of the Legat.</item>
                     <item>That after all theſe things, the Legat and the Earle of <hi>Montfort</hi> ſhould reſtore vnto him, all his Lands and Signories, when it ſhould pleaſe them.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>Theſe Articles being communicated to the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> he found them ſo vniuſt, that he would ſtay no longer in that place, but counſelled the Earle of <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze</hi> preſently to mount on horſe-backe, for feare leſt they ſhould ceaze vpon his perſon, euen to the full execution of thoſe Articles, who it ſhould ſeeme went about to enrich themſelues by his ſpoyles. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the ſaid King of <hi>Aragon</hi> had perſwaded the ſaid Earle that hee ſhould put no more confidence in the Legat and Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> hee caſt in his teeth his too great facillitie, ſaying vnto him in <hi>Gaſcongne</hi> tongue: <hi>Pla bous an pagat,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>They haue well payed you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Legat and the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> being much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented that this prey had eſcaped their hands, and knowing that he would no more ſuffer himſelfe to bee abuſed and ouer-reached by words, they endeuored to get that by force, which either by faire words or foule they could not. Whereupon they went preſently and beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Montferrand,</hi> into which the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> had put the Earle <hi>Baudoni</hi> his brother, with the Vicount of <hi>Montelar, Remond</hi> of <hi>Pierregourde,</hi> and <hi>Pons Roux</hi> of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> and diuers other valiant men to defend that place, which he knew to be of great
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:173840:140"/>importance. After ſome breach and aſſaults, the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> being out of all hope to winne this place by force of Armes, deſired to ſpeake with the Earle <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni,</hi> which hauing obtained, he told him that his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made it appeare vnto the world, that he had deſire to vndoe him, in that hee had ſhut him vp in ſo paltrie a place, which he very well ſaw hee could not long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, for that at the arriuall of that world of Pilgrims, which were now marching towards him, hee would quickly know, how great an ouerſight it was to locke vp himſelfe within ſo weake a hold: That if he did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any violent aſſault of theſe Pilgrims, there would be no more place for mercie. That if he would yeeld himſelfe and the place, hee would leaue it to his guard for the Church, and beſides, he would make him, for the time to come, a partner of his conqueſts, with ſuch aduantage, that hee ſhould ſhortly bee a greater man, and in greater authoritie than his brother, who had procured vnto himſelfe, by his rebellion, his vtter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow. That hee could neuer haue power ſufficient to reſiſt the force of ſo many Kings, Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, who ſent their people to this warre, rewarded by their owne zeale, without any charge of the Church. That euery man would commend and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire this his retreat, beſides that happineſſe he ſhould gaine vnto himſelfe, by conſecrating himſelfe to the ſeruice of God and his Church, and acquitting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that people amongſt whom there was not any that was not iudged by the Church worthy to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the fire. The Earle <hi>Baudoni</hi> ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to bee carryed by the promiſes and faire ſpeeches of the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> and ſo deliuered vp the place, and put himſelfe into <hi>Bruniquel,</hi> a place very ſtrong which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:173840:140"/>belonged to the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> and promiſed neuer to beare Armes, but in defence of the Church. Theſe two places drew with them, to the Earle <hi>Simons</hi> part, the places of <hi>Rabaſteins, Gaillac, Montague, La Guarda, Pech, Selſas, La Guipia,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Antonin,</hi> with other places neere adioyning.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> being much aſtoniſhed to ſee himſelfe betrayed, and abandoned by his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bewayled his misfortunes at <hi>Toulouze,</hi> where from day to day hee attended to bee inueſted; when vpon the ſurcharge of theſe euils, hee vnderſtood that the Legat and the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> had wonne vnto them the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> his one and only prop vpon earth, vnder God. The meane to worke it was this: The Legat writ vnto him, that he ſhould winne great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, and doe greater ſeruice to the Pope and to the Church, if he would once againe become a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for the peace of the Church. And to that end they entreated him to come to <hi>Narbonne,</hi> where they hoped to lay a good foundation. Hee tooke his iourney thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where the firſt thing they propoſed, was, to make ſome agreement betwixt the Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> and the Church, and the Earle <hi>Simon.</hi> A premeditated deſigne againe to ſpoyle the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> of his ſuccours. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they gaue him to vnderſtand, that the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> deſired to liue with him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they propoſed vnto him, that he was content that his ſonne ſhould marry the daughter of the ſaid Earle <hi>Simon;</hi> in regard of which alliance, the King of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:173840:141"/>
                     <hi>Aragon,</hi> gaue to the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> the inueſtiture of the Earledome of <hi>Beziers,</hi> which before hee would neuer agree vnto, nor to that of <hi>Carcaſſonne,</hi> which he likewiſe at the ſame time obtained. But that which did moſt hurt the Earles of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> and of <hi>Foix,</hi> was, that they cauſed the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> to ſweare, that he would no more fauour the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> but carry himſelfe as a Neuter in this warre betwixt the Church and them.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> hauing gotten that which he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that is, to alienate the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> from the Earles of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> and of <hi>Foix,</hi> hee tooke his time to bend his forces both againſt the one and the other.</p>

The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> commanded them all to goe to the ſpoile, whereupon the Pilgrims ranne into the Vineyards, Orchards and Gardens, cut downe all trees that bare fruit, plucked vp the Vines by the roots; at what time the Preſident of <hi>Ageues</hi> came forth of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> with a great number of the inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who ſeeing them to ſpoile their poſſeſſions, ranne vpon the Pilgrims with violence, ſcattered here and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173840:142"/>there through the fields, and ſlew a great number of them. On the other ſide the Earle of <hi>Foix</hi> conducting ſome troopes of horſe and foot, ſlew as many as hee met with. The Earle of <hi>Bar</hi> held his troopes in better order, and ſeeing the diſorder eſpecially of thoſe that were flying away, hee cryed out, a <hi>Bar,</hi> a <hi>Bar;</hi> which the inhabitants of <hi>Toulouze</hi> vnderſtanding, charged them ſo brauely, before any of them could gather themſelues vnto him, that he was diſcomfited with the reſt. The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> retired his troopes into <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louze,</hi> and commanded ſolemne thankes to bee giuen vnto God, for ſo admirable a victorie ouer his enemies.</p>
                  <p>The fame of the Earle <hi>Remonds</hi> victories being ſpread abroad, there came vnto him diuers ſuccours, from all the parts round about him, for they were all weary of the troopes of the Pilgrims, and willingly offered both their goods and their liues to driue them out of the Countrey.<note place="margin">Chaſſ. lib. <hi>3.</hi> chap. <hi>14.</hi> pag. <hi>169.</hi>

The Vauntgard was conducted by the Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> and Prince <hi>Roger</hi> his ſonne. The maine battell by <hi>Remond</hi> Earle of <hi>Toulouze.</hi> The rereward by the Prince and Lord of <hi>Bearn.</hi> This Armie was compoſed of fiftie thouſand foot, and ten thouſand horſe, and beſides that, the Citie of <hi>Toulouze</hi> was furniſhed with a good and ſtrong garriſon, and all munitions and inſtruments of warre. The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> put himſelfe into <hi>Caſtlenau d' Arri.</hi> The ſituation of this place was good, and the Caſtle one of the beſt; and there were in the Citie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souliers and great Captaines, and great ſtore of munition for a long ſiege. The Earle of <hi>Foix</hi> made his approach, lodged himſelfe neere the rampiers,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:173840:145"/>where hee framed many fabricks. In the meane time the enemy ſallied forth of the Cittie, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues very rudely and reſolutely vpon an Army of the Vauntguard, but they were with ſuch courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed, that diuers remaining dead within the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the reſt retired to bethinke themſelues of a better courſe. The Subburbs were taken by the beſiegers. The Earle <hi>Roger</hi> was there wounded with a ſtone, caſt from the Citie by one of their Engines. The Earle of <hi>Toulouze</hi> incamped himſelfe vpon a little hill, right ouer againſt the Caſtle, intrenching and enuironing himſelfe with railes and barriers. The Prince of <hi>Bearn</hi> lay on the other ſide of the Citie. The Armie of the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> increaſed daily, vpon a report giuen forth that the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> was there ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t vp, ſo great a deſire had euery one to ſee his ruine. And becauſe there were too many of the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> at this ſiege, it was thought good that the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> ſhould take a part of the Army to ſurprize certaine ſmall holds and Caſtles, which were ſomewhat diſaduantagious to the Army. He tooke <hi>Puylaurens, Albi, Rabaſteins, Gaillac, Montagut,</hi> and <hi>Sauerdun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> began to ſee his ouer-ſight, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelfe to be incloſed within <hi>Caſtlenau d' Arri,</hi> and that inaſmuch as hee was the Generall, it was fit hee ſhould be at libertie, to prouide for all other places de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending vpon his authoritie. He left within the place, <hi>Guy de Leuis,</hi> called the Marſhall of Faith, and to the end he might ſlip out the better, he cauſed a ſally to be made vpon the beſiegers, ingaging certaine troops, whilſt he in the meane time might make his eſcape.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> being aduertiſed of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> was much offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173840:146"/>with, more for ſhame, than for any ill hee conceiued thereof: becauſe the report had beene euery where ſpread abroad that the Generall was in the Cage, and that he ſhould not come forth but bare-headed, the halter about his neck, and begging mercy. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained one of another. The Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> that they had left him without ſuccour in ſo dangerous a flight. The Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> that he would put himſelfe into ſo great danger, without knowledge giuen vnto any.</p>
                  <p>In the end they reſolued to raiſe the ſiege, becauſe of Winter, and a great leuy of Pilgrims marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, whoſe liues the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> did not greatly tender, becauſe hee had the Popes Bull, that whoſoeuer ſhould loſe his life in that warre, ſhould goe preſently to Paradice, as neat from all ſinne, as a Hen-rooſt from ordure. The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> was ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puft vp with pride, making himſelfe merry with that great preparation of warre, altogether vnprofitable to the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> eſpecially that they had ſuffered him to make an eſcape, being twelue to one. Vpon this retrait, they in <hi>Caſtlenau</hi> would needs follow the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; but it coſt them deare. For <hi>Roger</hi> made a furious returne vpon them, killing many of them, and beating them backe euen to the gates of the Citie.</p>
                  <p>The Monke of the Valley <hi>Sernay</hi> tells this Fable; That notwithſtanding there were a hundred thouſand fighting men in the Armie of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> yet they of <hi>Caſtlenau d' Arri</hi> went forth to their Vintage, and gathered their Grapes as if there had beene no enemy before the Citie, and that their ſeruants went to water their Horſes, halfe a league from the Citie, the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> not daring to charge them. See here the truth of a Monkiſh Hiſtoriographer. So likewiſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:173840:146"/>when he falls into outrages, they are without meaſure or end. In this Diſcourſe he growes very chollerick, againſt one <hi>Sauari</hi> of <hi>Mauleon,</hi> Preſident to the King of <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Guienne,</hi> who had conducted ſome troops before <hi>Caſtlenau d' Arri,</hi> in fauour of the <hi>Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> he cals him Infidell, Expugner of the Church, a dangerous poyſon, a wicked forlorne perſon, enemy to God, the Prince of Apoſtacy, artificiall in cruelties, the author of all peruerſeneſſe, a diabolicall man, nay the Deuill himſelfe. Doubtleſſe he had either giuen him a hard chaſe, or his ſtile is very Monkiſh.</p>
                  <p>After this retreat, all the Lords of the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> retired themſelues into their quarters. The Earle of <hi>Foix</hi> vnderſtanding that the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> was gone to <hi>Pamies,</hi> where he much troubled his Subiects, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from <hi>Toulouze</hi> with two thouſand men, and came to the gates of <hi>Pamies,</hi> offering battell to the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> but he would by no meanes harken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, finding his Pilgrims too weake. And doubting that at the Spring following the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> would take the field; the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> all the Winter thought of nothing ſo much, as to ſtrengthen the places which he held, to maintaine the ſieges. Among the reſt being deſirous to prouide for <hi>Faniaux,</hi> a place of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; <hi>Roger</hi> perceiuing it, lay in Ambuſh in ſuch manner, and to ſuch purpoſe, that he diſcomfited all thoſe that brought either victuals or munitions.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> who doubted nothing ſo much as the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> cauſed the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat to write vnto him, that he ſhould no more meddle with the affaires of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> except he would intangle himſelfe in the ſame miſeries with them, and include himſelfe in the ſame excommunication. He
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173840:147"/>likewiſe cauſed <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> to write vnto him, intreating him not to fauour thoſe that were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Pope and to the Church: The Legat like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe cauſed him to write to the Pope, touching the ſame matter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe intreaties of the Pope, and the <hi>French</hi> King, were vnto him as expreſſe Commands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Earle of <hi>Foix, Toulouze</hi> and <hi>Comminge,</hi> preſſed him to aſſiſt them, he told them he would doe it; but it was fit hee ſhould firſt doe his endeuour to obtaine that by gentle and peaceable meanes, which by warre could not be obtained without danger. That the Legat was in counſell with all thoſe of his part, that he would write vnto them, and that if hee could not obtaine what he deſired by Letters, he would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them to do him reaſon by Armes. He writ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the ſaid Councell, beſeeching them to end theſe deadly warres, enterpriſed vnder a pretence of Religion, offering for the Earles, their obedience to the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but yet that they ſhould neuer promiſe any peace before reſtitution was made vnto the ſaid Earles, of all their lands and goods. The Councell <hi>de la Vaur</hi> returned this anſwer.</p>

You may call to minde if you pleaſe, the infinite offers, grants and graces, which our holy Father the Pope hath offered vnto him, after innumerable cruelties and horrible outrages. You may likewiſe remember the kinde entertainment, which hee found in the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Nerbonne,</hi> by the Abbot of <hi>Ciſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux,</hi> &amp; Legat at <hi>Montpelier</hi> two years ſince; as alſo the offers which were made vnto him, which he would not accept of: Which grace and fauour he ſo much ſcorned, that he made it appeare confidently, and with all oft, that he was not only enemy to God, but to his Church, for which cauſe he hath deſerued to be baniſhed for euer from God, his Grace, and his Church. Touching the requeſts of the Earle of <hi>Foix, Comminge,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Bearne;</hi> they haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed the oathes giuen by them, and in ſtead of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating themſelues to that kinde and courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous admoniſhment, they are filled with that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hereſie, for which to their great ſhame and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomie, they were excommunicated.

                     <q>Sir, and you my Maſters &amp; Friends; Foraſmuch as ambition can teach men both valour and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy, and auarice can plant in the heart, of a Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy brought vp in the ſhade and in idleneſſe, an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to depart from his houſhold harth, and to commit himſelfe to the billowes of the Sea, and the mercy of angry <hi>Neptune</hi> in a ſmall and fraile veſſell, it ſhall be great weakneſſe, and litherly negligence in vs, who by the renowned Acts of our Trophees are knowne euen to the Confines of <hi>Arabia,</hi> if we ſhall now come by a ſeruile and treacherous acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement to ouerthrow the Tables and Regiſters of our valours ſo highly eleuated. No, no, mine arme ſhall neuer conſent thereunto, we are not now in bondage. I and my ſonne chuſe rather to make triall of the inconſtant hazzard of warre, than to bring vpon vs and ours ſo great and ſo notable an infamy. And therefore, for the honour of God quit vs of that ſhame, that men take no notice of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable eſtate, mourning &amp; ſighing after our loſſes, like Diſtaffe-bearers. If we muſt needs bow, let it be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:173840:148"/>when we haue firſt done the parts of good and braue Captaines. It is an aduenturous and high enterpriſe, (you will ſay) but it was reſolued vpon by your ſelues, <hi>Que ie voy maintenant les reſſors qui lui donnent le branle de ſa cheute.</hi> Fare ye well. Sir, We yeeld not our conſent in any thing; Come what come may.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> was much moued with this diſcourſe of the Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> wherein hee layeth an imputation vpon him, that hee was the cauſe of their ruine, becauſe he had animated them againſt the Legat and the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> and that now hee left them as a prey, by procuring a peace worſe than a bloudy warre. You haue Sir (ſaith hee) opened a doore to our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to tyrannize ouer vs, if they had accepted of it, and to a glorie more great, than they could hope to attaine by Armes, for we had beene all their Subiects, without any other charge, than your owne inſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. As for my ſelfe (ſaith he) I had rather haue giuen my ſelfe the ſtab, than to haue drunke of that cup. And after many examples produced by him of thoſe that haue changed a miſerable life for a preſent death, killing themſelues before they would ſerue for Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees to their enemies, he continued his diſcourſe as followeth.</p>
                  <p>For mine owne part, I had rather follow theſe great Spirits, than hauing ſo often giuen teſtimony of my valour for another, preferre life before honour by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lazie and negligent in a buſineſſe that concernes my ſelfe. And though Fortune deny me all meanes, to make oppoſition againſt that wrong that another ſhall offer mee, yet my courage will neuer giue way, that I ſhould make my ſelfe the ſpeech of the people,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:173840:149"/>or a triumph for men more vnworthy than my ſelfe. This their deniall of what you demanded, doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me, and it vpholds our honor, for we muſt either haue broken our faith, or played the Cowards like needy beggers, and liued a life more cruell, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, than any torment of <hi>Phalaris;</hi> like miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men yeelding our neckes to the yoake of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and confeſſing our ſelues beaten, ſell our owne libertie, and our childrens after vs, and that for euer. Good God what a blow were this Sir? For aſmuch therefore as the tempeſt is growen ſo great, and wee are driuen to ſo extreme a neceſſitie, imbrace vs in your armes, be our head, ſeruing vs for an example, a watch-tower, a conduct: So ſhall we engage our wills and our liues, to ſhew our ſelues your moſt humble ſeruants in time of need, and valorous Souldiers when occaſion ſhall be offered. And though I be now worne with yeares, yet neuer had I greater courage or better reſolution.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> on the other ſide, intreated the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> not to abandon their cauſe, offering vnto him both his goods and his life, to fight vnder his authoritie.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> being ouercome with theſe intreaties, and moued with compaſſion towards the afflicted, in the end tooke armes, and ſent this ticket of defiance, to the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> by two Trumpetters. Indeuour without delay to execute the will of the Pope, or to fight with your Lord, and if you fall into my hands, you ſhall pay for it. It is your dutie, and I will haue it ſo, and I rather deſire it, than to put my ſelfe to the charge of a great Army for your ruine.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> made good vſe of this Letter of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:173840:149"/>defiance, for hee ſent it into diuers parts of Europe, ſhewing by the Biſhops and Monkes that preached the Croiſade, that the care was not now for the Earle of <hi>Toulouze, Foix, Comminge,</hi> or the Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> but for a puiſſant King, who had made himſelfe the Generall of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> and that if he were not aſſiſted extraordinarily, the cauſe of the Church was at an end; and therefore he entreated all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, eſpecially the King of <hi>France,</hi> to giue his beſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in theſe holy warres, and extreme neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> writ to the King of <hi>France,</hi> that the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Montfort</hi> had a ſpirit puffed vp with high conceits, farre exceeding both the capacitie of his vnderſtanding, and his forces; That al his intentions were no other than plaiſterings, vnder the pretence of Religion, and in the meane time he intended nothing ſo much as to bee a King in deed, and <hi>Simon</hi> by name. He beſeecheth the King by Letters and by his Agents, that hee would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe himſelfe in this warre, neither on the one part, nor the other. Which he obtained of the King, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it troubled him to ſee his Subiects continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drawne to the ſhambles of this warre of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes,</hi> vnder a pretence of the Popes pardon, and to ſee ſo many of his great Lords his Kinſmen ſo vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Earle <hi>Simon.</hi> When the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that the King of <hi>France</hi> was made a Neuter, he was much afflicted therewith, hauing now no other recourſe but to the threats of the Legat to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him, if he ſhould proceed any farther. The Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat ſent him an Ambaſſage and Letters. The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> returned this anſwer; Goe ſpeedily and tell your Maſter that I will come and ſee him, and giue
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173840:150"/>him an anſwer with ten thouſand fighting men, and will him to defend himſelfe, for I will teach him to play with his Peere.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the yeere of our Lord, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred and thirteene, and the thirteenth of September, the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> with the Earle <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> of <hi>Toulouze, Remond</hi> Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Comminge,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> appeared in the field with their Armie, compoſed of ſeuen thouſand horſes, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand foot. They tooke <hi>Muret</hi> a little Citie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the borders of the Earledome of <hi>Foix,</hi> ſeated vpon <hi>Garonne,</hi> but they tooke not the Caſtle. The Earle <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was of opinion, that that was the place where the Armie of his enemies ſhould waſte and ſpend it ſelfe, becauſe the Caſtle was good and ſtrong, and that if he made reſiſtance for ſometime, it would of it ſelfe bee ſcattered and ouerthrowne. Hee therefore put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into that Caſtle, with ſome ſmall number of his moſt expert and valorous Souldiers, and furnihed it with munition, and gaue by his preſence ſuch aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vnto the beſieged, that they thought themſelues inuincible, of ſuch power is the good opinion that the Souldiers haue of their Captaine, to confirme thoſe that are moſt weake.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome that began to enter into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173840:151"/>of the proceedings of the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> in that he would not accept of a compoſition ſo aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for himſelfe and the Lords of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> as the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> had offered him, when hee ſaw the inequalitie of their forces. For the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> had not aboue ſeuen hundred men on foot, and fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe. It is not good to aſſault a man, that hath no hope to eſcape but by armes, for there is not a more violent Schoole-miſtris than neceſſitie. But the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> thought it no time to ſmoothe and to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, after ſo many inſolent brauados againſt his Lord, of which the Monke hath noted ſome;<note place="margin">The Monke of the Valleis Sernay. <hi>Chap.</hi> 126.</note> as where hee ſaith, that hee writ certaine letters vnto him, without any ſalutation, containing theſe tearmes, that if hee continued in his obſtinate defiance, hee returned the defiance vpon himſelfe, and that from thence forward he held not himſelfe bound to doe him any ſeruice, and that hee doubted not, by the helpe of God, to defend himſelfe againſt him and his confederates.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> hauing theſe inſolent ſpeeches engrauen in his memorie, thought him vnworthy of any grace or fauour in this his weakneſſe, eſpecially imagining that this his ſubmiſſion might onely bee to auoid this dangerous ſhocke, and to attend his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, that hee might afterwards be more inſolent than before: that at other times when the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> was in his greateſt height, followed with a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, it was his manner alwayes to ſcoffe at the ſubmiſſions of the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> and of <hi>Foix,</hi> and that it were therefore great weakneſſe not to returne like for like: that he would afterwards mocke them, if they ſhould haue compaſſion of him that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had pitty of any: that ſince hee had ſo long time
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:173840:151"/>taken his pleaſure to prouoke the Lords to bee his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, hee ſhould haue furniſhed himſelfe with greater numbers of Souldiers, and ſuch as might haue more ſollid pay than the Popes pardons, that might not leaue him at his greateſt need, nor bee perſwaded like Pilgrims, that there was nothing more to bee gained: for hee that hath gotten Paradice (as the Pope would make men beleeue in his Bulls) hath nothing elſe to get but blowes if he deſire any thing more, as they vſe to doe who continue in this warre after their quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, their fortie dayes are ſpent.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> therefore thought it was fit he ſhould take his aduantages againſt a man ſo malicious and ſo inſolent. But none can promiſe himſelfe the victorie, but the eternall, who is the God of warre, for neither the number of men, nor the equipage or furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can giue the victories, but onely God, who many times maketh his power to appeare in the weakneſſe of men.</p>
                  <p>Their Armies were ranged in this manner. The Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Roger,</hi> lead the Vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Armie of the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> conſiſting of three thouſand horſe, and ten thouſand foot, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Pikemen, which were the ſureſt armes in thoſe times. The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> of <hi>Toulouze</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the battell, aſſiſted by the Earle of <hi>Comminge,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> wherein there were aboue foure thouſand horſe, and twenty thouſand foot, without any reereward.</p>
                  <p>The Vauntgard of the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> was conducted by <hi>Guy de Leuis</hi> Marſhall of the Faith, conſiſting of fiue hundred horſe, and three hundred foot. The Earle was in the battell with a thouſand horſe, and foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173840:152"/>men on foot, almoſt all French, without any reereward.</p>
                  <p>The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> made his turnes and returnes in the head of his Armie; which was thought to bee a great ouerſight, becauſe the Generall of an Armie muſt not carry himſelfe like a Captaine of Arquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziers, not runne his Curuets to be ſeene, becauſe in the loſſe of him, conſiſts the loſſe of the battell, and the Countrey which he defends; but hee is to keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the heart of the Armie, to direct by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as occaſions fall out, the whole body of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, which is not to ſtirre but by his command and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> quite contrary, came downe from the Caſtle of <hi>Muret</hi> with a ſlow pace, ſhut vp (as it were) and in good order: The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, thought hee came rather to caſt himſelfe downe at his feet, than to fight. The King of <hi>Aragon</hi> had lodged his Armie in a place very aduantagious and fauourable. They ioyne battell, and preſently the Vantgard of the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> was almoſt cut in peeces, and it went ſo ill with him and his, that it ſeemed vnto him that that was the place whither God had called him, to pay with vſurie, for all his fore-paſſed cruelties and inſolencies, to his owne ſhame; when the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> in the head of his Vauntgard approched for his totall ruine and deſtruction; for being come neere to an ambuſh of foure hundred Harquebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiers which the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> had placed in certaine old decayed houſes, he was wounded to death, and fell from his horſe. Whereupon they fell preſently into ſuch a diſorder and aſtoniſhment, that doe what the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> of <hi>Foix</hi> and <hi>Comminge,</hi> what they could to ſtay this cowardly Armie, they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:173840:152"/>could preuaile nothing with them, but were enforced themſelues to follow the trace, and to commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the hazard and euent of this ſhamefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, flying directly to <hi>Toulouze.</hi> The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> taking the aduantage of his victory, and following the chaſe, euen to the gates of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> ſlew ſo many men in this dayes fight, that himſelfe was moued with compaſſion, grieuing for the hard hap of his Lord the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> and cauſing a ſearch to bee made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the dead, commanded him to be interred, not in the ground which they call holy, becauſe hee was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, but in a field nere to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Granier.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Biſhops, Prieſts and Monkes, which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Caſtle of <hi>Muret,</hi> from whence they might behold from farre the euent of this daies iourney, haue had a Monke that giues them the whole commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this ſo renowned a victory,<note place="margin">The Monke of the Valleis Sernay, <hi>chap.</hi> 127.</note> affirming that it was obtained by the benediction which the Biſhop of <hi>Comminge</hi> gaue to the Army with the Croſſe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to the Pilgrims Paradice, without any paine of Purgatory, and that if they died in that fight, they ſhould all be receiued into heauen as Martyrs. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hee ſaith, that all the Eccleſiaſticall perſons that were within the place, retired themſelues to a Church all the time of the Combat, and that they praied with ſuch ardency, that they ſeemed by their crie rather to houle than to pray.</p>
                  <p>He that writes the Hiſtory of <hi>Languedoc</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">The Hiſtory <hi>de Lang. fol.</hi> 12.</note> that they got the aduantage becauſe they had receiued the benediction from the Biſhops, and had adored the wood of the true Croſſe in the hands of the Biſhop of <hi>Toulouze.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> acknowledged
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173840:153"/>that they ſaw herein an extraordinary proofe of the iudgement of God, in that the king of <hi>Aragon,</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted at that time, more to his owne power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, than the helpe and ſuccours of the eternall God. But yet for all this, they loſt not their courage, though they had loft in this iourney, fifteene thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fighting men, neither did they diſpaire of the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and goodneſſe of their cauſe, it not being the firſt armie that hath beene diſcomfited in a iuſt quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, nor the firſt bad cauſe, that hath beene maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with victory.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Earle <hi>Simon</hi> being puffed vp with this victorie, ſent one to ſummon the Earle of <hi>Toulouze, Foix,</hi> and <hi>Comminge,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> to deliuer vnto him, the keis of thoſe cities and caſtles that they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and that they ſhould ſubſcribe to what it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Legat, or reſolue miſerably to periſh.</p>
                  <p>He receiued no anſwer, but euery one betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his owne territories, there to prouide the beſt they could poſſibly for their affaires. The Earle <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> retired himſelfe to <hi>Montauban,</hi> and writ to thoſe of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> from whence he was but then departed, that he vnderſtood that <hi>Rodolph</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Arras</hi> was comming with a great number of Pilgrims, and therefore, foraſmuch as he ſaw, that they had no meanes to defend their city, againſt ſo great a force, that they ſhould treat and grow to ſome compoſition with the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> reſeruing only their hearts vnto himſelfe, vntill God ſhould giue meanes, to free them from thoſe miſeries wherein they were plunged, by the inſatiable auarice of their common enemie. In the meane time, he, the Earle of <hi>Foix, Comminge,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> did their endeuours to trouble and to infeſt the enemies Armies, with all the power they
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173840:154"/>could for their common good. The citie of <hi>Toulouze</hi> deputed ſix of the principall men of the city, to offer to the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> the keies of <hi>Toulouze.</hi> He receiued them honourably and commanded them not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him without his permiſſion. In the meane time, he writ to <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſonne of king <hi>Philip,</hi> that ſince the battle of <hi>Muret,</hi> they of <hi>Toulouze</hi> offered to yeeld themſelues vnto him, but his deſire was that he ſhould haue the praiſe of that conqueſt being onely worthy of himſelfe. King <hi>Philip</hi> his father would not heretofore permit, that he ſhould war againſt the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes,</hi> becauſe he had promiſed the King of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> to carry himſelfe as a neuter betwixt both, but now hearing of the death of the ſaid King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> he ſuffered him to goe. The Prince being at <hi>Toulouze,</hi> the citie was deliuered into his hands, and preſently, the Legat, hauing aſſembled the Biſhops of his ranke, it was concluded that the pillage ſhould be granted to the Pilgrims, and that the city ſhould be diſmant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Caſtle of <hi>Narbonne</hi> excepted; which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently executed, contrary to the promiſe which had beene giuen them, that nothing ſhould be altered within the citie. This good vſe did the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> make of the preſence and forces of Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> for otherwiſe, he durſt not haue enterpriſed the ſaccage and diſmantling of this goodly and great citie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the endangering of his fortunes, were his forces neuer ſo great.</p>
                  <p>At this very time arriued <hi>Bonauenture</hi> the Popes new Legat, and of thoſe that tooke on them the Croſſe the Biſhop of <hi>Beauuois,</hi> the Earle of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Sauoy,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Alençon,</hi> the Vicount of <hi>Melun, Mathew de Montmorenci,</hi> and other great Lords
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173840:154"/>that accompanied him. The Legat ſeeing ſo many Pilgrims, began to feare leſt Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of diuers places which the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> held, to the preiudice of the Popes authoritie, vnder whoſe name all thoſe conqueſts were made; for the auoiding whereof he ſent vnto all thoſe places that held for the ſaid <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> the abſolution and ſafeguard of the Church, in ſuch ſort that the Prince thinking to make an aſſault vpon any of them, they produced their abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and ſhewed that they were vnder the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Church. And this Legat grew ſo auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as to tell Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> that ſince he was become a ſouldier of the Croſſe, he was ſubiect to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, becauſe he did repreſent the perſon of the Pope, whoſe pardons he was come to obtaine, by obeying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Prince diſſembled this audacious bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Narbonne</hi> was diſmantled by the agreement of the ſaid Prince, which neither the Legat nor the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> would not haue durſt to enterpriſe without his preſence. The Biſhop of <hi>Narbonne</hi> did what he could, to hinder the diſmantling of it, affirming that it did much import, that a place in the frontiers of <hi>Spaine</hi> ſhould bee preſerued with the walles and rampiers thereof: but the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> and the Legat were very inſtant to the contrary, &amp; they obtained their deſires.</p>

                  <p>Here endeth the good fortune of the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> for in the end of this leuy of Pilgrims which Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> brought with him, he had enough to doe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelfe from blowes; notwithſtanding the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes</hi> were alſo wearied with continuall warres, and viſited from time to time with new expeditions, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they ſunke vnder the burthen of them.

At this very time, other Letters
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173840:156"/>were brought vnto him, whereby he was called into <hi>Dauphine,</hi> where there was one <hi>Ademar</hi> of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and one <hi>Ponce</hi> of <hi>Monlaur,</hi> who hindred the paſſage of the Pilgrims, who came downe by the Riuer <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> and were conducted by the Archbiſhops of <hi>Lion,</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne.</hi> There were likewiſe the Cities of <hi>Monteil-Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> and <hi>Creſt Arnaud,</hi> who tooke part with the <hi>Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> who were a great hindrance to the Pilgrims. <hi>Simon</hi> came to treatie and compoſition with <hi>Ademar</hi> of <hi>Poitiers</hi> and <hi>Monlaur,</hi> not hauing power to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo many enemies.</p>
                  <p>Againe, he was giuen to vnderſtand, that the <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians</hi> were returned about <hi>Carcaſſonne;</hi> and thither he came and was well beaten, inſomuch that he was conſtrained to ſhut vp himſelfe within <hi>Carcaſſonne,</hi> hauing not wherewithall to keepe the field, before hee had new ſupply of Pilgrims to ſuccour him. Seeing at the laſt that he got nothing of the Earle of <hi>Foix</hi> by armes, he had recourſe to his ordinary wiles and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties, hoping to worke his ruine, vnder a pretence of amitie. He cauſed therefore the Legat <hi>Bonauenture</hi> to write vnto him, that he had compaſſion on him, for that he was ſo obſtinate in ſo great a warre, to his great charge, and the loſſe of the bloud of his Subiects, which if he would he might end in a ſhort time, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his iourny to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; declaring his innocency to the Pope; that he would giue him his beſt aſſiſtance as far forth as poſſibly he could, to procure the reſtitution of all his Lands. But yet it was very neceſſarie that the Church ſhould haue ſome gages of his fidelitie, that is, that he ſhould deliuer into his hands the Caſtle of <hi>Foix,</hi> the one &amp; onely meanes to take away all ſhadow and ſhew of falſe play, and that incontinently after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

                  <p>He ſuffered himſelfe to be cheated and gulled by theſe promiſes, deliuered vnto him the Caſtle of <hi>Foix,</hi> and tooke his iourney to <hi>Rome:</hi> but if he went a foole thither, a foole he returned. For the Legat had written to <hi>Rome,</hi> to the Conclaue and to the Pope, that the Earle of <hi>Foix</hi> was one of the moſt dangerous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques that was amongſt the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> a man of great courage and valiant, and moſt to be feared: that if he were ſubdued, the Earle of <hi>Toulouze</hi> would be much weakned; that he had gotten from him the meanes to doe any hurt, by obtaining by faire words thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the Church would neuer haue gotten by armes, namely the Caſtle of <hi>Foix,</hi> and that they were to take heed that they made no reſtitution of his lands, which if they did, it would bee impoſſible that the Church ſhould euer bring the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> to their vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine. The Pope was willing enough to ioyne in his ouerthrow, but becauſe hee came vnto him with ſubmiſſions, he feared leaſt it might bee a meanes to hinder others from euer putting any confidence in the Pope. He was prodigall of his Croſſes, his Bulls, and his Words, but in effect he commanded his Legat, that he ſhould not reſtore vnto him thoſe places, vntill hee had giuen good proofes of his obedience and iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Preſently vpon his returne hee addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the Legat, to enioy the effect of his faire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. The Legat gaue him to vnderſtand, that his hands were bound by the Pope, becauſe there were ſome clauſes in his Bulls that did binde him to a new proceeding, and to know in good earneſt what his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency was; but yet he ſhould aſſure himſelfe of his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:173840:157"/>affection, and that he ſhould not attribute to him, if he receiued not his full content, and that he would doe his beſt endeuour to make loue and friendſhip betwixt the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> and himſelfe. The Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> by little and little with-drew himſelfe, fearing to be arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, walking about the fields and houſes of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects (as for his owne, they were all in the hands of the Earle <hi>Simon:</hi>) There he curſed his owne facilitie, to ſuffer himſelfe to be gulled by a Prieſt, bites his fingers for anger to ſee himſelfe ſo blockiſhly abuſed, after ſo many trickes and ſtratagems plaid againſt him. The Earle of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> and the King of <hi>Aragon,</hi> reſolue to make a leuy of their Subiects, and preſently to build a Fort at <hi>Montgranier,</hi> a place very ſtrong by nature. In a few daies they made it a place of defence by the means &amp; labours of their poore ſubiects, who bewailing their own miſeries &amp; their Lords, trauelled day &amp; night very willingly, to bring the work to an end. This place being built, he put therin a gariſon, &amp; left there his ſon <hi>Roger.</hi> The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> beſieged it, &amp; in the end took it by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition was, that <hi>Roger</hi> ſhould not beare armes for one whole yeare againſt the Church. An Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle that troubled much this valiant Lord. For he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe for the ſame yeare into a houſe, where he counted the moneths and the daies, till the time was expired wherein he might either die valiantly in fight, or vanquiſh his enemies. And to this purpoſe he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times conferred with the ſonne of the King of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> lately ſlaine, how he might carrie himſelfe to finde a meanes to be reuenged of his Fathers death.</p>

                  <p>The Pope was much moued with theſe outrages and would willingly haue done ſome iuſtice, but that it was told him, that if hee ſhould cauſe the Earle of <hi>Montfort,</hi> to make reſtitution of that which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the ſeruice of the Church, that he ſhould not from hence-forward, finde any that would fight ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Pope or the Church: As alſo, that if hee ſhould determine the reſtitution, yet the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> had reaſon, not to giue ouer his hold, vntill hee were fully ſatisfied for his trauels and expences.</p>
                  <p>The Pope returned theſe affaires to the Legat, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him in generall termes, to reſtore the Lands to all thoſe that ſhewed themſelues faithfull to the Church, and as touching the ſonne of the Earle <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> his pleaſure was,<note place="margin">The Monke of the Valleis Sernay, <hi>Chap.</hi> 152.</note> that that Land that the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> had in <hi>Prouence,</hi> that is to ſay, The Earl dome of <hi>Veniſſe</hi> ſhould be reſerued either in part or all for the maintenance of his ſonne, prouided that he gaue good and aſſured teſtimonies of his loyaltie and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, ſhewing himſelfe worthy of diuine mercy.</p>
                  <p>They being returned, demanded of the Legat the execution of their Bulls, requiring the reſtitution of their Lands.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt exploit of warre of <hi>Remond,</hi> the the ſonne of the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> was the taking of <hi>Beaucaire,</hi> where hee made himſelfe Maſter of the Citie: afterwards hauing almoſt famiſhed thoſe in the Caſtle, the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> being no way able to ſuccour them, made a compoſition for thoſe that were within it, that is, that they ſhould depart, onely carrying with them their baggage and neceſſary furniture. The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> loſt at that place a hundred Gentlemen, which he laid in ambuſh, neere the Citie, which they within perceiuing, made a ſalley forth, and cut them in peeces. The young Earle <hi>Remond</hi> wonne great renowne at this ſiege, and gaue the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> to vnderſtand, that his ſonne <hi>Aimeri</hi> ſhould haue in this young Lord, a thorne in his foot, that ſhould make him ſmart as much, as in his time he had giuen cauſe of trouble and vexation to his father. The Earle <hi>Montfort</hi> went from hence to rauage and make ſpoile at <hi>Thoulouze.</hi> The Biſhop was gone thither before, and told the Conſuls and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall of the Citie, that they were to make their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before the Earle <hi>Simon.</hi> They went vnto him,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:173840:160"/>but to their great loſſe, for they were no ſooner come before the Earle, but hee commanded them all to bee bound with cords; whereof ſome taking notice, that had meanes to eſcape to the Citie, an alarme was giuen within the Citie, ſo hot, that before his arriuall all the people were in armes: but being entred by the Caſtle <hi>Narbonne,</hi> they recouered certaine Towers which were yet remaining, and put themſelues into certaine places, and hauing already begun to pillage neere the Caſtle <hi>Narbonne,</hi> the people fortified themſelues, and gaue the chaſe with ſuch violence to thoſe Boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haylers and Fire-houſes, who had already ſet fire on ſome houſes, that they draue them to the Caſtle of <hi>Narbonne.</hi> The Earle <hi>Guy</hi> came vpon the very inſtant of this combat, to the ſuccour of his brother the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> but after he had fought a while, hee was faine in the end to flye to his brother. A great part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> were enforced to retire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Steuens,</hi> and the Tower of <hi>Maſcaro,</hi> and the Biſhops houſe, where a great number were ſlaine. The Biſhop, who knew that he had beene the cauſe of this misfortune, hauing counſelled the Citizens to make their appearance before the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> and the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> to ceaſe vpon them, ſtill continuing his treaſons, went forth of the Caſtle <hi>Narbonnes,</hi> ranne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſtreets, crying out vnto the people to pacifie themſelues, for the Earle determined to end theſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences with mildneſſe and gentleneſſe, and that they ſhould not refuſe the wayes of peace. He alleadged ſo many matters vnto them, that in the end they gaue care vnto him, and were willing to hearken to a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, ſeeing themſelues diſmantled and brought vnder the ſubiection of a Caſtle &amp; ſtrong garriſon, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173840:160"/>knowing too well, that at the firſt ſuccours of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, their Citie would be expoſed to pillage. When they were to know the conditions of their peace, the firſt Article was: That the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> would yeeld to nothing, before all the Inhabitants had carryed their armes to the Towne-houſe. This point was hardly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but at the laſt they yeelded vnto it: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> cauſed his people to make their approch, and ſo being ſeazed on the Towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe againſt a people diſarmed, and hauing conuayed their Armour to the Caſtle <hi>Narbonnes,</hi> hee impriſoned the principall men of the Citie, and cauſed them to bee ſent out of <hi>Thoulouze</hi> whither hee thought good, being ſo vnciuilly vſed, and with ſuch inhumane cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that a great number died by the way. Thus was <hi>Toulouze</hi> diſpeopled of it principall Inhabitants, and the reſt put to their ranſome, whereby the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> did greatly inrich himſelfe. And ſhortly after retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the Countrie <hi>Bigorre,</hi> where hee could not take the Caſtle of <hi>Lourde,</hi> he diſcharged his choller vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this poore Citie, permitting it to be pillaged by his Pilgrims, and then cauſed the reſt of the Towers that were yet about the Citie to be beaten downe.</p>
                  <p>In this meane time, the poore Earle of <hi>Toulouze</hi> was at <hi>Mountauban,</hi> who vnderſtanding of the bad vſage of his miſerable ſubiects, for certaine moneths could not but bewaile their lamentable eſtate with ſighs and teares.</p>

                     </note> the Legat held a Councell at <hi>Montpelier,</hi> for the renewing of the Armie of the Church, and to confirme the authoritie of the Earle <hi>Simon.</hi> The Monke of <hi>Sernay</hi> ſaith, that he was there

                  <p>The Councell ſent vnto him to come and receiue this dignitie of Prince and Monarch. He entred into the Citie, and being in the Church of our Lady <hi>des Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> where the Prelats of the ſaid Councell were to pronounce their ſentence in fauour of the ſaid <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> they heard a rumor in the Citie. They ſent to know what the matter was: It was told them, that the people had vnderſtood, that the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> was within the Citie, and that thereupon they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke themſelues to their armes, purpoſing to kill him, as being their capitall enemie. He was aduiſed to ſteale away along by the walls of the Citie, and to ſaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for feare left the whole Councell ſuffered with him. He went therefore on foot, without companie, leſt he ſhould haue beene knowne at the Gate, and ſo he eſcaped this great danger. So that he ſaw himſelfe in one houre honored almoſt as a God, choſen and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Prince and Monarch, and to flie diſguiſed, and to hide himſelfe like a baſe ſcundrell, for feare of the raſcall people.</p>
                  <p>In regard of the reſolution of this Councell, the Pope euer writ vnto him,<note place="margin">The Monke of the Valleis Sernay, <hi>chap.</hi> 148.</note> as to a Monarch, ſtiling him, <hi>The actiue dexterious Souldier of Ieſus Chriſt.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173840:161"/>him a Bull, dated the fourth of the Nones of Aprill, by which hee giues him authoritie to keepe all thoſe lands hee had gotten vnder his power, granting vnto him the reuenues, profits and power to adminiſter iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, conſidering (ſaith the Pope) that you neither can, nor ought to make warre at your owne charge. This the Popes bountie of another mans purſe, in a buſineſſe where he had nothing to giue, made him to goe to the King of <hi>France,</hi> to bee inueſted into the Dukedome of <hi>Narbonnes,</hi> the Earledome of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> together with all the lands, which the Souldiers of the Croſſe had conquered and taken from thoſe they call Heretikes, or the Protectors of them, which he obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the King to hold in fee. The Monke ſaith,<note place="margin">The Monke of the Valleis Sernay, <hi>Chap.</hi> 153.</note> it was not poſſible for him to relate the honor which was donne vnto him vpon his way going to <hi>France,</hi> there being neither Citie nor Towne through which he paſſed, where the Clergie and people came not to ſee him, crying out, Bleſſed is hee that comes in the name of God. For ſuch and ſo great (ſaith he) was the deuout Religion of the people towards him, that there was not any that thought not himſelfe happy to touch the hem of his garments.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere one thouſand, <note place="margin">1216.</note> two hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, hee returned from <hi>France</hi> with an hundred Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,<note place="margin">The Monke of the Valleis Sernay, <hi>Chap.</hi> 161.</note> who had cauſed this expedition of the Croſſe to bee preached in their Biſhoptikes, being reſolued with this great Armie to make himſelfe Maſter, Prince and Monarch, of all thoſe lands which the Pope had giuen him. And to make it apparant that he had not treated or made any agreement with <hi>Girard Ademe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> or <hi>Guitaud</hi> Lord of <hi>Monteil-Aimar,</hi> nor with <hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> but vntill ſuch time as hee had power

Guitaud</hi> or <hi>Girard</hi> made great reſiſtance; but when the Inhabitants ſaw the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Pilgrims, they entreated their Lord to come to compoſition, for feare leſt the Citie ſhould be pillaged. Which hee did, though it were with the loſſe of his Caſtle. From thence he went and beſieged the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Creſt-Arnaud,</hi> belonging to <hi>Aimar</hi> of <hi>Poitiers.</hi> He that commanded within, did yeeld it vp out of cowardlineſſe, for otherwiſe it had beene impoſſible the Pilgrims ſhould haue taken it. Afterwards the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> gaue a daughter of his to a ſonne of the ſaid <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and there was peace concluded betwixt the ſaid <hi>Poitiers</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> againſt whom hee had a long time before made cruell warre. A little before, the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> had married one of his ſonnes to the daughter of <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>Viennois,</hi> and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other to the Counteſſe of <hi>Bigorre.</hi> All which alliances did fortifie him much againſt his enemies. All men trembled before him, and with this great Armie of Pilgrims that followed him, he tooke <hi>Peſquieres</hi> neere to <hi>Nyſmes,</hi> and <hi>Bezonce,</hi> and put all to the ſword hee found within, not ſparing the women. Hee tooke his way to <hi>Toulouze,</hi> to pillage and to raze it, and to ſeeke the Earle of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> euen to the center of the Earth, if he were there to be found; at which time hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued letters from his wife, aduertiſing him that hee ſhould ſpeedily come to deliuer her from the hands of the Earle of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> who had beſieged her in the Caſtle <hi>Narbonnes,</hi> that hee was very ſtrong and had all the people at his deuotion, who had reciued him with great applauſe, crying out with a loude voice, Long liue the Earle of <hi>Toulouze.</hi> That he was accompanied
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:173840:162"/>with his Nephew, the Earle of <hi>Comminge, Gaſpar de la Barre, Bertrand de Iorda, Engarrand</hi> of <hi>Gordo,</hi> Lord of <hi>Caraman, Armand de Montagu,</hi> and <hi>Eſtephe de la Valette,</hi> all braue and valiant men and well accompanied.</p>
                  <p>This was about the end of the yeere one thouſand two hundred ſeuenteene,<note place="margin">1217.</note> that the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into <hi>Toulouze,</hi> the Drumme beaten, the Enſignes diſplayed, and the Trumpets ſounding. The people preſſing to caſt themſelues downe at his feet, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his legges, and to kiſſe the hem of his garment, and killing as many as they found in the Citie, that tooke part with the Earle of <hi>Montfort.</hi> Whereas, had the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> come directly to <hi>Montauban,</hi> at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from <hi>France,</hi> the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> could not haue told what to haue done, but he ſtayed at <hi>Monteil-Aimar</hi> and <hi>Creſt Arnaud,</hi> and <hi>Beſince,</hi> and <hi>Paſquieres,</hi> and made delaies about the mariages ſo long, that the Earle had time to gather his troopes together, and to prepare himſelfe for a ſtrong aſſault. In ſuch ſort, that when hee was aduertiſed that hee was at <hi>Toulouze,</hi> the greater part of his Pilgrims were returned into <hi>France.</hi> But yet it was neceſſary hee ſhould goe to <hi>Toulouze</hi> with thoſe forces that he had: for his wife was in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be loſt. And hee that had beene the death of ſo many women and children, was doubtfull what would become of his, falling into the hands of his enemies.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> created an officer, which they called <hi>Vignier,</hi> or <hi>Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:173840:163"/>appoint to euery one his quarter, and his Captaine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in times of combat. There came from all parts, troopes of ſuccours to the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> of thoſe that deſired conſideration for the violencies of the Earle <hi>Simon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Guy</hi> was one of the firſt in the combat, for his brother the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> but he was beaten and put to flight: The Archbiſhop of <hi>Aix,</hi> and of <hi>Armag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac,</hi> with their Pilgrims retired themſelues without fight. The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> being come, made ſhew to beſiege <hi>Toulouze:</hi> but the frequent iſſues of thoſe that were within, gaue him to vnderſtand, that it was not for his good. He aſſembled therefore the Prelats and Lords, to take aduiſe of what was to bee done. The Legat perceiuing the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> ſomewhat aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, ſaid vnto him. <q>Feare nothing, for in a ſhort time wee ſhall recouer the Citie, and put to death, and deſtroy all the Inhabitants; and if any of the Souldiers of the Croſſe ſhall die in this purſuit, they ſhall paſſe to Paradice as Martyrs, and hereof they ſhall aſſure themſelues. To whom one of the great Captaines anſwered, Monſieur Cardinall, you talke with great aſſurance, but if the Earle beleeue you, it will be little for his profit. For you and all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prelats, and men of the Church, haue beene the cauſe of all this euill and ruine, and will bee yet more if he beleeue you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was no time for Monſieur the Cardinall to bee offended with this audacious reply, but he muſt needs ſup vp this cenſure. The reſolution was, that there ſhould be no more any aſſault giuen, but that the Citie ſhould bee beſieged on the ſide of <hi>Gaſcongne.</hi> For which cauſe the Earle of <hi>Montfort</hi> cauſed one part of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:173840:163"/>his Armie, to paſſe the Riuer <hi>Garonne,</hi> towards S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi> now they within the Citie made ſo blunt a ſalley, and to ſuch purpoſe, that they put their enemies to flight. During this combat, came the Earle of <hi>Foix</hi> with his freſh troopes, as well of his ſubiects, as <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarreans</hi> and <hi>Catalans,</hi> who violently ſet vpon the Earle <hi>Montfort,</hi> purſuing him euen to the brinke of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronne,</hi> where with affrightment and precipitation, they caſt themſelues in heapes into their Boats, and many were drowned in the Riuer. The Earle <hi>Simon</hi> alſo fell in, all armed, with his horſe, and hardly eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> cauſed a generall aſſembly to bee made at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Saornin,</hi> wherein hee exhorted the people to giue thankes vnto God for this happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of victorie, which they had obtained againſt their enemies, which was a teſtimonie of Gods loue, and that they ſhould hope for better: hee exhorted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one to giue their helping hands to build and to prepare, and to cauſe their warlike engins to play a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caſtle <hi>Narbonnes,</hi> becauſe this place being laſt by the enemie, their totall ruine muſt needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and being once recouered by them, they ſhould be in ſafetie. In a very ſhort time were their woodden engins to caſt ſtones, their Slings, their Mangonnels to dart their Arrowes, their Fowlers, Croſſebowes and other Inſtruments which were in vſe in thoſe times prepared, and all of them mounted againſt the Caſtle <hi>Narbonnes;</hi> which made thoſe to tremble that were within.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Montfort</hi> being at <hi>Montolieu,</hi> tooke coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell how to carry himſelfe in this tedious ſiege, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt enemies ſo animated.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> hee was to take a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:173840:164"/>good heart vnto him, for Monſieur the Cardinall had ſent letters and meſſengers throughout the world, to giue him ſuccours, and that ſhortly he ſhould haue ſo many people, that hee ſhould not want power to doe what he would. The abouenamed <hi>Robert de Pequigni</hi> anſwered him, that hee ſpake his pleaſure, and that if the Earle of <hi>Montfort</hi> had not beleeued him nor any ſuch, hee had beene in thoſe troubles that now hee was, but hee had beene at peace within <hi>Toulouze,</hi> and that hee was the cauſe of that danger they now were in, and of the death of ſo many people as were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſlaine by the wicked counſell that hee had giuen.</p>
                  <p>After many combats, the winter grew on, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the courſe of the beſiegers, who withdrawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to couert where they could about <hi>Toulouze,</hi> expected with good denotation, and much impatien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, new ſuccours of Pilgrims. The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> on the other ſide, incloſed the Citie with a Rampier, and fortified himſelfe againſt the Caſtle <hi>Narbonnes,</hi> and prepared to receiue the Pilgrims whenſoeuer they ſhould preſent themſelues vnto them. In this meane time hee ſent his ſonne to ſeeke for ſuccours. In the end, about the Spring time, in the yeere one thouſand two hundred and eighteene,<note place="margin">1218.</note> there came to the Earle <hi>Simon,</hi> an hundred thouſand Souldiers of the Croſſe, and to the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> great ſuccours from <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congne,</hi> conducted by <hi>Narcis de Monteſquiou.</hi> As alſo the young <hi>Remond</hi> of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> and <hi>Arnaud de Villemur</hi> brought vnto him goodly troopes. This great multitude of Pilgrims being come, the Legat and the Earle <hi>Simon</hi> thought good they ſhould earne their pardon, knowing that at the end of fortie daies, this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173840:164"/>great cloude of Pilgrims would vaniſh. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commanded them, inſtantly to giue a generall ſcalado, which was deferred to the next morning, by which time they had other worke to doe; for the very firſt night of their arriuall, putting their confidence in their great multitude, they kept no good guard. Which the Earle of <hi>Toulouze</hi> perceiuing, made a ſalley out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and that with ſo good ſucceſſe, that the next morning all the field was couered with dead bodies.

There was ſhewed not long ſince at <hi>Toulouze</hi> a head, which ſome did beleeue was the head of the Earle <hi>Remond,</hi> which was ſaid to be alwaies without a ſepulture; but there is no likelihood that he that died amongſt his owne, and being Ruler ouer them, ſhould not haue ſo much credit after his death, as to bee put into a Sepulcher: that he that by his valour had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored all his Subiects to their houſes,<note place="margin">Holaga. pag. <hi>164</hi>
                     </note> and their Citie to it former greatneſſe, he whoſe death they lamented as a Father, ſhould be caſt out like a Dogge. It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true nor hath it any reſemblance of truth, that they ſhould deny him this laſt office of charitie, which they haue not refuſed to beſtow vpon their greateſt enemies, for it was neuer heard of that the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> haue denied ſepulture vnto any.</p>
                  <p>As touching the Earle of <hi>Foix, Remond,</hi> he was a Prince of whom the Hiſtorie giues this teſtimony, that he was a Patron of Iuſtice, clemency, prudence, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, magnanimitie, patience and continency; a good Warriour, a good Huſband, a good Father, a good Houſe-keeper, a good Iuſticer, worthy to haue his name honoured, and his vertues remembred through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all generations. When this good Prince ſaw that he was to change the earth for heauen, he defied death with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:173840:170"/>an aſſured conſtant carriage, and tooke comfort in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the world, and the vanities thereof, and calling his ſonne <hi>Roger</hi> vnto him, hee exhorted him to ſerue God, to liue vertuouſly, to gouerne his people like a Father, vnder the obedience of his Lawes, and ſo gaue vp the ghoſt. His Wife the Lady <hi>Philippe</hi> of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,</hi> followed him ſhortly after, not without ſuſpition of poyſon, by ſome domeſticall enemy of the <hi>Albin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſes,</hi> whoſe religion ſhe profeſſed with all deuotion. A Princeſſe of a great and admirable prouidence, faith, conſtancy, and loyaltie. She vttered before her death many excellent ſentences, full of edification, as well in the <hi>Caſtilian</hi> tongue, as the <hi>French,</hi> in contempt of death, which ſhe receiued with a maruellous grace, fortifying her ſpeeches with moſt Chriſtian conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the great comfort and edification of all that were preſent, and in this eſtate ſhe changed her life.</p>
                  <p>All theſe deaths made a great alteration in the wars of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> both on the one ſide and the other.</p>

                  <p>The young <hi>Remond,</hi> Earle of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> was bound by promiſe to the king, to goe to receiue his abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pope <hi>Honorius,</hi> and afterwards he ſhould giue him peaceable poſſeſſion of all his lands: but the death of the king in the meane time happening, he ſaw the Realme of <hi>France</hi> in the hands of king <hi>Lewis,</hi> a childe and in his minority, and the regency in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and gouernment of his mother. Hee thought that hauing to deale with an infant king, and a woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, he might recouer by force that which he had quit himſelfe of by agreement. He therefore reſolued to take armes, being encouraged thereunto, by the ſuccours of the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> his ſubjects, who were in great hope to maintaine their part in ſtrength and vigor, during the Non-age of the King of <hi>France,</hi> but they were deceiued in their proiect.

                  <p>The more the perſecution increaſed, the more the number of the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> multiplied, which <hi>Imber</hi> of <hi>Beauieu</hi> perceiuing, he went to the Court to let them vnderſtand, that without ſuccours, he could no longer defend the countrey, and the places newly annexed to the Crowne and patrimony of <hi>France,</hi> againſt the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenſes</hi> and the Earle <hi>Remond.</hi> In the meane time whileſt he was abſent, the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> tooke the Caſtle <hi>Sarrazin,</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt places that <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> had in his keeping, and holding the field did much hurt to his enemies.</p>

                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> retired himſelfe into <hi>Toulouze</hi> where he was preſently ſhut vp, and all the country round about, euen harueſt and all ſpoiled and waſted.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:173840:172"/>the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> into their hands, they would make vſe of him to perſecute them, that they would eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the inquiſition and kindle their fires againe, and ſo vtterly deſtroy them both bodies and ſoules: but the reaſons of theſe men were ouercome by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate cries of the common people almoſt famiſhed, who could not ſee the time wherein they were fettered with the halter, that ſhould ſtrangle them. Beſides the enemie wanted not people in <hi>Toulouze,</hi> that were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to terrifie the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> ſaying, that he was not now to deale with <hi>Americ</hi> of <hi>Montfort,</hi> but with a king of <hi>France,</hi> who had power ſufficient to ouerthrow him: that continuall feuers kill men, and long warres would at the laſt burie them all. The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> paſſed his word to the Abbot to be at a certaine day at <hi>Vaſieges,</hi> there to reſolue vpon that which was to bee done, to bring the peace to a perfection. In the meane time a truſe was agreed vpon with the <hi>Toulouzains,</hi> for certaine daies. The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> came at the day to the place appointed, and ſo did the Abbot of <hi>Grandſelue.</hi> After much diſcourſe and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion touching a peace, the Abbot made him beleeue, that it would be for his greater aduantage to bee in <hi>France,</hi> than in that place; and that foraſmuch as the buſineſſe concerned the King, that it was neceſſary that the Queene-mother being Tutrix vnto him, and Regent of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould be preſent, and that more would be done in a few daies, than in a whole yeare, the buſineſſe requiring ſo many iournies and goings and commings, which peraduenture would bee long and vnprofitable: and ſo pawned his faith that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhould receiue all contentment. Being vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by theſe promiſes, he conſented to come into
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:173840:173"/>
                     <hi>France,</hi> whetherſoeuer the Queene-mother ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. <hi>Meaux</hi> was the place ſhe made choiſe of, and his time was appointed.

                  <p>There was therefore now no more queſtion of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or communications, but of ſubmiſſion to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhould be enioyned him.

                  <p>
                     <hi>The Anſwer of the Earle of</hi> Foix <hi>was, That hee could not forſake his part nor his beleefe, in a time wherein hee ſhould giue men occaſion to thinke that hee had more feare than reaſon, and that it was neceſſary for ſo fruitfull a change, ſuch as they expected of him, that the truth ſhould ouercome, not the allurements of promiſes, nor the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of armes: That he would ſee that world of Pilgrims come that was threatned, and he did trust in God, that hee ſhould make them to know the iuſtice of his cauſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the temeritie of their vow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> was not ſatisfied with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, much leſſe the Legat, who found another way to winne him vnto them. And that was, that there were within his lands and territories, and about the ſaid Earledome, ſubiects of his, who being frighted with an apprehenſion of their ruine, ſhould intreat him to haue compaſſion both of himſelfe and his poore ſubiects, who ſhould doubtleſſe be ouerthrowne by this laſt violence. And at the very ſame time, hee cauſed the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> to write to the principall men of the Countries of the ſaid <hi>Roger</hi> Earle of <hi>Foix;</hi> that there was an excellent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie offered their Lord, if hee made not himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thereof by his obſtinacie: that it was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes to make them liue in perfect peace: that they ſhould perſwade him, whileſt the occaſion and time ſerued, before the expedition of the Croſſe were on foot.</p>
                  <p>The ſubiects of the Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> partly for their owne intereſt, partly for feare, leſt their Lord being ſtrooken in yeeres, without wife and children, ſhould leaue them to the mercie of the firſt Conquerour, if he ſhould depart this life without a lawfull heire; they
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:173840:178"/>ioyned together in humble ſupplication to their Lord, at the inſtant reaſons and perſwaſions of the ſaid Earle of <hi>Toulouze.</hi> They obtained by their requeſts and teares, that which the Earle of <hi>Toulouze</hi> could not by threats, prayers nor promiſes: for hee promiſed them, that hee would treat with the Legat for their peace, and would accept thereof for their good and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment.</p>
                  <p>The Pope was aduertiſed of the intention of the Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> and therefore hee ioyned with the firſt Legat in the Earledome of <hi>Foix</hi> another, that is to ſay, the Cardinall of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ange,</hi> accompanied by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Narbonnes, de Folae, Guillaume de Torration,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Couſerans, Bernard de la grace, Peter</hi> Abbot of <hi>Bolbonne, Iohn</hi> Abbot of <hi>Comelonge, William</hi> Abbot of <hi>Foix, Peter de Thalames,</hi> the Legats Lieutenant, <hi>Lamkert de la Tour,</hi> and diuers others.

                  <p>The Legat related to the Earle of <hi>Foix,</hi> the great contentment that the Pope had,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The Earle <hi>Roger</hi> replyed to the Legat and the reſt that were preſent, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Meſsieurs,</hi> I haue long ſince bid Rhetorick a dieu, hauing made profeſſion to pleade my cauſe, and to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:173840:178"/>make my entries with engins and ſpeares, which muſt be my excuſe, if like a Souldier I vtter my intentions. My Couzen, the Earle of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> hath procured (for which I thanke him) that my enemies will now be pleaſed with reaſon, to heare the cauſes of our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uies, and why wee haue taken Armes, which to this preſent would neuer be granted; as alſo hee deſireth that we ſhould giue ouer the purſuit of thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to wrong vs, vpon an aſſurance (ſaith he) that the King of <hi>France</hi> ſhall maintaine euery one with Iuſtice and Equitie. Truly, I confeſſe, that I neuer deſired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more than to maintaine my libertie, being as yet (as it were) in the ſwadling clouts of my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Our Country owes onely one ſimple homage to the Earle of <hi>Toulouze,</hi> for raiſing it to an Earldome, but it acknowledgeth no other Maſter but my ſelfe: and as for the Pope, I neuer offended him; for he hath neuer demanded any thing at my hands, as a Prince, in which I haue not obeyed him. Hee is not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with my Religion, ſince euery man is to haue it free. My Father hath alwaies recommended vnto me this libertie, to the end that being ſetled therein, though the heauens ſhake I might looke vpon them with a conſtant and aſſured countenance, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that they could neuer hurt me. Nothing trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles me but this: For in conſideration that the Earle of <hi>Toulouze</hi> holds mee diſcharged of that homage, which he pretends to belong vnto him, I am ready lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly to imbrace the King, and to doe him ſeruice in the ſame condition, vnder the dependance of my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rights, which maintaine me in Regall authoritie in that Country. It is not feare that makes me ſtagger or yeeld to your deſires, and that conſtraines me to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:173840:179"/>humble my will and deſires to the earth, or dunghill-like to ſubmit my ſelfe to your appetite, but being prouoked by that benigne and generous feare of the miſeries of my Subiects, the ruine of my Countrey, the deſire not to be accounted mutinous, braine-ſicke, and the fire-brand of <hi>France,</hi> I yeeld my ſelfe to this extremitie; otherwiſe I would bee as a wall without breach or eſcalado, againſt the braueſt of mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. I giue you therefore a gage of my affection, for the good of the peace in generall. Take my Caſtles of <hi>Foix, Mongaillard, Montreal, Vicdeſos, Lordat,</hi> whileſt that I yeeld him that homage that you demand.</p>
                  <p>As for the Earle of <hi>Comminge,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Bearne,</hi> it was impoſſible they ſhould continue firme in their reſolutions, to make reſiſtance, being deſtitute of theſe two props, the Earles of <hi>Foix</hi> and <hi>Toulouze:</hi> For they were but weake, both in money and men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then the end, to the outward appearance of the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi>

                  <p>He was no doubt miſ-informed; For the Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> who relateth all that paſſed in thoſe times, hath made no mention thereof, neither is it likely that he would haue forgotten ſo famous a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie ouer the <hi>Albingenſes,</hi> whom hee hated to the death.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:173840:180"/>the death of his Father, and win that by the ſword that had beene taken from him by in-iuſtice.

The Archbiſhop of <hi>Narbonnes</hi> animated alſo the people of his Dioceſſe to goe to make an end of that poore remainder of the <hi>Albingenſes</hi> that were left.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Prieſts with their troopes, preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues before the gates of <hi>Carcaſſonne.</hi> The Citie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued them, but when they came to the Towne the gates were ſhut againſt them. <hi>Amelin</hi> made a ſpeech vnto thoſe that ſhewed themſelues vpon the rampiers, telling them that he was come thither for their preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

Vpon this conference came <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauel,</hi> who ſet ſo hotly and valiantly vpon the troope of Pilgrims that accompained the Legat, that he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, beating and killing them, till he came to the

And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he heard of any troopes of Pilgrims to come, he went to meet them, laying ambuſhes for them, and many times ouerthrew them before they could ioyne themſelues to the Legat.</p>

                  <p>The Monkes Inquiſitors would reply, and make ſome vſe of that which had beene informed, to frame their inditements againſt thoſe that had thus accuſed them, to the impeachment of their honour, terrifying them with threats, which made thoſe that had thus moued their patience, to enter into conſideration with themſelues, that ſince they muſt fall into the ſnare of the ſaid Inquiſitors, and ſo be vtterly vndone, it was better for them to deliuer themſelues this once, and that they ſhould teach others to carry themſelues more aduiſedly. So growing ſtill more eager and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in their diſcourſe, they came to blowes. But the Monkes Inquiſitors and their Officers were ouermat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, for there were ſlaine (as the Hiſtoriographer of <hi>Languedoc</hi> reports) nine, that is to ſay, The fiue Monks aboue ſpecified, and the foure Officers.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:173840:182"/>would haue men beleeue, that it was a premeditated treaſon, wherein he ſhewes himſelfe to be partiall and paſſionate.</p>
                  <p>The Earle <hi>Remond</hi> did very well make it appeare, that he was no way conſenting to this riot, for hee made an exact ſearch and inquirie after the Authors of this ſedition, but yet doe what he could, he could not free himſelfe from ſuſpition. The ſame Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ſaith, that the atrocitie of the fact, conſtrained the Authors to take Armes, and to beginne againe a kinde of warre; but there is not any Writer that makes mention thereof; and therefore to be confidered of before it be beleeued. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth came to <hi>Lion</hi> about that time. He ſends out his thunder-bolts againſt the murderers, and hee looked not vpon the Earle <hi>Remond</hi> with a good countenance, who was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuilly reiected in that requeſt that he made vnto him, touching a diſpenſation for the marriage of his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin <hi>Beatrix,</hi> daughter of the Earle <hi>Berenger,</hi> Earle of <hi>Prouence.</hi>

                  <p>A. According to Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> That Faith which is without workes, is dead. Againe, Faith is nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out workes: Or, a dead faith, is to beleeue there is a God, and to beleeue thoſe things concerning God, and not to beleeue in God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is thy Faith?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The true Catholike and Apoſtolike Faith.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is that?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. It is that which in the Apoſtles Symbole is diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into twelue Articles.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is that Symbole?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. I beleeue in God the Father Almighty, &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:173840:187"/>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what meanes canſt thou know that thou beleeueſt in God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By this. Becauſe I know that I haue giuen my ſelfe to the obſeruation of the Commandements of God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many Commandements of God are there?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Ten, as it appeareth in <hi>Exodus</hi> and <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Which are they?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Hearken O Iſrael, I am the Lord thy God. Thou ſhalt haue no other Gods but me. Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any grauen Image, nor the likeneſſe of any thing that is in Heauen, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Vpon what doe all theſe Commandements depend?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Vpon the two great Commandements, that is to ſay; Thou ſhalt loue God aboue all things, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is the foundation of theſe Commandements, by which euery one ought to enter into life, without which foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation no man can worthily fulfill the Commandements?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> None can lay any other foundation but that which is laid, euen Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what meanes may a man attaine to this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By Faith: So ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 2.6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I lay in Sion a chiefe corner ſtone, elect, precious, and he that beleeueth in him, ſhall not be confounded. And our Sauiour ſaith; Hee that beleeueth in me ſhall haue eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How doeſt thou know that thou beleeueſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Becauſe I know him to bee true God, and true man, who was borne, &amp; ſuffered, &amp;c. for my redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173840:188"/>and Iuſtification; and that Houe him, and deſire to fulfill his Commandements.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what meanes may a man attaine to the Eſſentiall vertues, that is to ſay, Faith, Hope, and Charity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By the gifts of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doeſt thou beleeue in the holy Ghoſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. I doe beleeue: For the holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne, and is a perſon of the Trinity, and according to the Diuinity, is equall with the Father and the Sonne.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doeſt thou beleeue God the Father, God the Sonne, God the holy Ghoſt, to be three Perſons: Then there are three Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. No, there are not three.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But yet thou haſt named three?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. That was by reaſon of the difference of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, not of the Eſſence of the Diuinity: For though there be three Perſons, yet there is but one Eſſence.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>After what manner doeſt thou adore, and ſerue that God, in whom thou beleeueſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. I adore him by an exterior and interior adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Exterior, by the bowing of the knees, the lifting vp of the hands, the inclination of the body, with hymnes and ſpirituall ſongs, faſting, inuocation: but inwardly by a holy affection, a will ready to doe what hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and I ſerue him by Faith, Hope, Charity, in his Commandements.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doeſt thou adore and ſerue any other thing as God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. No.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Wherefore?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Becauſe of his Commandement, whereby hee hath ſtraightly commanded, ſaying; Thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerue.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173840:188"/>As alſo, I will not giue my glory to another. Againe, I liue ſaith the Lord: Euery knee ſhall bow vnto me. And Chriſt Ieſus ſaith: There ſhall be true worſhippers, who ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and truth: and the Angell would not be adored by Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor Saint <hi>Peter</hi> by <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>After what manner doeſt thou pray?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. I pray according to that Prayer that was taught vs by the Sonne of God, <hi>Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Which is the other ſubſtantiall vertue belonging of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity to ſaluation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. It is Charity.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is Charity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. It is a giſt of the holy Ghoſt, whereby the ſoule is reformed in will, illuminated by Faith, whereby I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue all that I ought to beleeue, and hope whatſoeuer I ought to hope.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doeſt thou beleeue in the holy Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. No, for that is a creature: but I beleeue there is a Church.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What is that thou beleeueſt touching the holy Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. I ſay that the Church is conſidered after a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner; the one in it ſubſtance, the other in it Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery: Conſidered in it ſubſtance, by the Church we vnderſtand, the holy Catholike Church, which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all the Elect of God, from the beginning of the World to the end, in the grace of God, by the merit of Chriſt, aſſembled by the holy Ghoſt, ordained from the beginning to eternall life, the names and number of whom is known onely to God, who hath elected them; And laſtly, in this Church there remaineth no excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated perſon: But the Church conſidered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173840:189"/>to the veritie of the Miniſtery, are the Miniſters of Chriſt, with the people ſubiect vnto them, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, vſing their Miniſtery by Faith, Hope, and Charity.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what markes doeſt thou know the Church of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By fit and conuenient Miniſters, and by the people who participate in the trueth of that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How doeſt thou know the Miniſters?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By the true apprehenſion of faith, by ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, by the life of good example, the preaching of the Goſpell, and the due adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what markes doeſt thou know the falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By their fruits; by their blindneſſe, by their wicked workes, by their peruerſe doctrine, and by their vnfit diſorderly adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How may we know their blindneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. When they, not knowing that truth which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth of neceſſity to ſaluation, they obſerue humane inuentions, as the Commandements of God, of whom that is verified that the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh, and that hath beene alledged by our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. <hi>This people honour mee with their lips, but their heart is farre from me; but they ſerue me for nothing, teaching the doctrine and commandements of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what meanes or markes are wicked workes made knowne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By thoſe manifeſt ſinnes of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Rom. 1. ſaying, that they that doe ſuch things
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173840:189"/>ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what markes is falſe doctrine knowne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. When men teach againſt Faith and Hope, as diuers kinds of Idolatries, worſhipping the reaſonable, ſenſible, viſible, or inuiſible creature: for it is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely, with his Sonne and the holy Ghoſt, that muſt be ſerued, and no other creature. But contrarily we attribute to man, and to the worke of his hands, or to his words, or to his authority, in ſuch manner, that men being blinded, thinke that God is a debtour vnto them for their falſe religion, and couetous Simony of Prieſts.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what markes is the diſorderly adminiſtration of the Sacraments knowne?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. When the Prieſts know not the intention of Chriſt in the Sacraments, and teach that all grace and truth is included in them, by the onely outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and leade men to the participation of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, without the truth of Faith, Hope, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. It is the will of the Lord, that all his ſhould take heed of falſe prophets, ſaying, <hi>Beware of falſe prophets.</hi> And againe, <hi>Beware of the Phariſes,</hi> that is to ſay, of their leuen and falſe doctrine. And againe, <hi>Beleeue them not, follow not after them. Dauid</hi> hateth all ſuch perſons, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>I hate the congregation of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> And the Lord commandeth vs to withdraw our ſelues from among ſuch people, Numbers 16.26. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the tents of theſe wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, leſt you be conſumed in all their ſinnes.</hi> And the Apoſtle, 2. Cor. 6.14. <hi>Be ye not vnequally yoked together with vnbeleeuers, for what fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſneſſe, and what communion hath light with darkeneſſe? what concord hath Chriſt with Belial, or what
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173840:190"/>part hath he that beleeueth with an Infidell,</hi> And, <hi>What a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement hath the Temple of God with Idoles? Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſeparated, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the vncleane thing, and I will receiue you.</hi> Againe, in the 2. Theſ. 3.12. <hi>We command and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you, by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that ye withdraw your ſelues from euery brother that walketh diſorderly.</hi> And in the 18. of the Reuel. 4. <hi>Come out of her my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſinnes, and that yee receiue not of her plagues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what markes may we know thoſe that are not in the truth of the Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By their publike ſinnes and erroneous faith; for we are to flie ſuch people, leaſt wee bee contaminated with their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what things oughteſt thou to communicate with the holy Church?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. I muſt communicate with the Church in regard of the ſubſtance, by Faith, by Hope, and by Charity, and by the obſeruation of the Commandements, and by finall perſeuerance in that which is good.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many Miniſteriall things are there?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Two, the Word, and the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many Sacraments are there?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Two, that is to ſay, Baptiſme, and the Supper of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>VVhat is the third vertue neceſſary to ſaluation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. Hope.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>VVhat is Hope?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. It is a certaine expectation of the grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to come.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what meanes doe we hope for grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By the Mediatour Ieſus Chriſt, of whom Saint
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:173840:190"/>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, Chap. 1.17. <hi>Grace came by Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And againe, <hi>VVe beheld his glory full of grace and truth, and we haue all receiued of his fulneſſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>VVhat is Grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. It is Redemption, Remiſſion of ſinnes, Iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, Sanctification.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>By what meanes doe wee hope for this Grace in Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. By a liuely faith, and true repentance, Ieſus Chriſt ſaying, <hi>Repent, and beleeue the Goſpell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>From whence doth Hope proceed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. From the gift of God, and his promiſes: and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He is able to accompliſh what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he promiſeth:</hi> for he hath promiſed himſelfe, that at what time ſoeuer a ſinner ſhall know him, and repent him of his ſinnes, and hope that hee will haue mercy, pardon, and iuſtifie, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>VVhat are the things that diuert a man from this hope?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. A dead faith, the ſeducing of Antichriſt to any other then Chriſt, that is to ſay, to Saints, and the power of that Antichriſt in his authority, words, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, Sacraments, reliques of the dead. The tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching men to haue hope, by thoſe meanes that direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe themſelues againſt the Trueth, and againſt the Commandements of God, as Idolatry after diuers manners, and Simoniacall wickedneſſes, &amp;c. Abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fountaine of liuing water giuen by grace, to runne after broken ceſterns, adoring, and honouring, and ſeruing the creature, by Prayers, and Faſtings, and Sacrifices, Donations, Offerings, Pilgrimages, Inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp;c. Truſting thereby to attaine grace, which none can giue, but God alone in Chriſt Ieſus. So that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:173840:191"/>in vaine they trauell, and loſe their ſiluer and their life, and doubtleſſe not only this life preſent, but that which is to come; for which cauſe it is ſaid, that the hope of felons ſhall periſh.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>And what ſay you of the bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary? <hi>For ſhe is full of grace, as the Angel teſtifieth, Haile</hi> Mary <hi>full of grace, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. The bleſſed Virgin hath beene, and is full of grace in her ſelfe, but not to communicate vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for her Sonne only is full of grace to beſtow on others, as it is ſaid of him; <hi>And we all receiue of his fulnes grace for grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Doeſt thou not beleeue the Communion of Saints?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. I beleeue there are two things in the which the faithfull doe communicate, the one is ſubſtantiall, the other Miniſteriall: They communicate in the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all by the holy Ghoſt, in God by the merit of Ieſus Chriſt. But they communicate in the Miniſteriall or Eccleſiaſticall, by the Miniſtery duely exerciſed, that is to ſay, by the Word, by the Sacraments, and by Prayer. I beleeue the one and the other of theſe two Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Saints. The firſt onely in God by the Spirit, the other in the Church by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>In what doth life eternall conſiſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. In a liuely working faith, and perſeuerance therein. Our Sauiour ſaith, Iohn 17.3. <hi>This is life eternall, that they might know thee the onely true God, and Ieſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent:</hi> And <hi>he that perſeuereth to the end ſhall be ſaued. Amen.</hi>

                     </note>O God of Kings, and Lord of Lords, I confeſſe my ſelfe vnto thee, for I am that ſinner, that hath grieuouſly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee, by mine ingratitude. I cannot excuſe my ſelfe, becauſe thou haſt ſhewed mee what is good and what is euill. I haue knowne what thy power is, and haue vnderſtood thy wiſedome; I haue taken notice of thy Iuſtice, and ſeene thy goodneſſe; and therefore all the euill that I haue done proceedeth from my owne corruption. O Lord forgiue me, and giue mee repentance, for I haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned thee by my pride and preſumption, I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen no credit to thy wiſedome, nor obeyed thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, but I haue tranſgreſſed them all; for which I am ſorry, and much diſpleaſed with my ſelfe. I haue not feared thy Iuſtice, nor thy Iudgements, but I haue committed many wickedneſſes, euen from my cradle vnto this day, neither haue I loued thy great bountie and goodneſſe as I ſhould, and as thou haſt commanded mee; but I haue giuen too great a truſt vnto the deuill, by the fraile corruption of my nature; I haue followed pride and hated humilitie; and if thou pardon me not I am vndone, ſo deepely is ſinne rooted in my heart. I am ſo carried away with the loue of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:173840:192"/>and vaine-glory, affecting the praiſe of men, that I beare but little loue vnto thoſe, to whom by their good deeds I am moſt obliged. If therefore thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue mee not, there remaineth nothing for my poore ſoule but euerlaſting perdition. Anger reigneth in my heart, becauſe I haue not endeuoured to alaye it, enuy fretteth mee becauſe I haue no charitie. O Lord for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue me for thy goodneſſe ſake. I am raſh, lazie, and ſluggiſh to doe that which is good; hardie and bold to doe euill, and more then diligent. O Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe mee thy grace, that I may not bee of the number of the wicked. I haue not ſhewed my ſelfe thankefull for that good thou haſt done vnto mee, and giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me out of thy loue, as I ought, and as thou haſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded mee; for I haue beene alwayes, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſeneſſe of my nature, diſobedient vnto thee in all things. O Lord forgiue mee, for I haue not ſerued thee, but contrarily I haue greatly offended thee. I haue beene too carefull to ſerue my body, and mine owne will, in many vaine thoughts and wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, wherein I haue taken pleaſure. I haue blinded my body, and exerciſed my thoughts and imaginations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee in many wickedneſſes, and I haue ſought after many things againſt thy will. Haue pitie on mee and giue mee humilitie. I haue caſt vp mine eyes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the vaine delights and pleaſures of this world, and I haue turned them away from thy countenance. I haue giuen eare to the ſound of vanitie, and to wicked ſpeeches, and it hath beene a grieuous thing vnto me to vnderſtand thy Law and thy Diſcipline. I haue committed many ſinnes, eſpecially in my vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for the ſtench of wickedneſſe hath beene more pleaſing, then the diuine ſweetneſſe of thy celeſtiall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:173840:192"/>honours; for adoring the euill, I haue therein taken greater contentment, becauſe I haue committed many ſinnes, and omitted much good that I ſhould haue done, and not acknowledging my faults, I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to caſt them vpon another. I haue not been temperate in my eating and drinking. I haue many a time and oft returned wrong for wrong, and therein I haue taken greateſt pleaſure. I haue a wounded body and ſoule. I haue ſtretched out my hands to touch vanitie, and I haue laboured to poſſeſſe the goods of another man, and to miſchiefe my neighbour. My heart hath delighted in that I haue ſaid, and much more in many other vaine delights and pleaſures. O Lord pardon mee and giue mee chaſtitie. I haue ill im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the time that thou haſt giuen mee, and I haue followed during my yonger yeeres, my vanities and pleaſures. I haue wandred from the right way, and haue giuen an ill example by my lightneſſe. I know but little good in my ſelfe, and I finde much euill. I haue diſpleaſed thee by my wickedneſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned mine owne ſoule, and hated my neighbour. O Lord preſerue mee that I bee not condemned. I loue my neighbour for my temporall benefit. I haue not carried my ſelfe faithfully, when there hath beene any queſtion of giuing and receiuing, but I haue had reſpect vnto the perſons, according to mine affection. I haue loued the one too much, and too much hated the other. I haue taken too little ioy and comfort in the good of the godly, and too great delight in the ſinne of the wicked. And beſides all the euill that I haue committed in times paſt vnto this preſent day, I haue not had any repentance, or diſtaſte of my ſinnes, anſwerable to my manifold offences. I haue many a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:173840:193"/>time and oft returned to that wickedneſſe I haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and now confeſſed, for which I am hartily ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. O Lord God, thou knoweſt that I haue confeſſed my ſelfe vnto thee, and that there are yet in me many wickedneſſes, which I haue not recounted vnto thee, but thou knoweſt the wicked thoughts, the wicked words, the wicked works that I haue committed vnto this day, O Lord forgiue me, &amp; giue me time in this life to repent me of my ſins, and vouchſafe me the grace in time to come, ſo to hate thoſe ſins I haue committed, as that I neuer offend in that kind any more, &amp; that I may ſo loue vertue and keepe it in my heart, that I may loue thee aboue all things, and feare thee in ſuch ſort, that when the houre of death ſhall come I may doe that that ſhall be pleaſing vnto thee.

As it is the manner of Merchants to doe, if when they are in danger of drowning, they willingly caſt their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize into the Sea, to ſaue their liues, they loue their liues better then their Merchandize: So thinke thou with thy ſelfe, that if vpon any occaſion, thou hadſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looſe thy temporall things, or receiue any loſſe or hinderance in them, as in thy Money, thy Houſes, thy

And therefore it is wonderfull, that there are ſome that frame vnto themſelues Figures and Images, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto them by their ignorance, and againſt the Commandement of God, the honour and reuerence which belongeth to one onely God.</p>
                     <p>

And if a man ſhould grant that they are Bookes, yet they are falſe, and ill written. For if Lay-people ſhall take example by thoſe Images and figures of the liues of Saints, it is moſt certaine that it is impoſſible. For the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was an example of humility, pouerty, and chaſtity, and they adorne her I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, rather with veſtments of pride, then humility. So that the Lay-people doe not reade in their habits humility, but pride and auarice, if they conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the ſaid Bookes corrupted, and ill written. For the Prieſts and the people in theſe dayes, are couetous, proud, and luxurious, and therefore they cauſe their Images to be pictured like themſelues.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This is falſe. For if wee will truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:173840:195"/>the Image of GOD, by doing good vnto men, we ſerue and honour the Image of GOD: For the Image of GOD is in euery man, but the reſemblance or likeneſſe of God, is not in all, but onely in thoſe where the thought is pure, and the ſoule hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But if we will truly honour God, wee giue place vnto the truth; that is to ſay, wee doe good vnto men that are made after the Image of God: we doe honour vnto God, when we giue meate to thoſe that hunger, drink to thoſe that thirſt, &amp; cloath to thoſe that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. And therefore what honour doe wee giue vnto God, when we ſerue him in a ſtock, or a ſtone; when we adore idle Figures without ſoules, as if there were ſome diuinity in them, and contemne man, who is the true Image of God? Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> vpon <hi>Mathew</hi> ſaith; That the Image of God cannot be painted or pictured in gold, but figured in man. The Money of <hi>Caeſar</hi> is gold, but the money of God is man. And therefore if the Iewes were commanded vnder the Law, that they ſhould deſtroy all the figures and Images, and addict themſelues to one onely God; as it is written in the firſt Booke of the <hi>Kings.</hi> But <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to all the Houſe of Iſrael: <hi>If you turne vnto the Lord with all your heart, and remoue from you all your ſtrange Gods, and keepe your heart vnto the Lord, and ſerue him onely, he will deliuer you from the hands of the Philiſtines.</hi> Much leſſe then ought Chriſtians to depend vpon ſuch ſignes and Images which the Iewes did not; but they ought rather to lift vp their affections vnto Chriſt, who ſitteth at the right hand of God.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:173840:196"/>Lord, muſt be carefull of foure things: The firſt is to ceaſe from all earthly and worldly labours: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, not to ſinne: The third, not to be idle in regard of good workes: The fourth, to doe thoſe things that are for the good and benefit of the ſoule. Of the firſt it is ſaid, <hi>In ſixe dayes ſhalt thou labour and doe all that thou haſt to doe, but the ſeuenth is the Sabboth of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt doe no manner of worke:</hi> and in Exodus it is ſaid, <hi>Keepe my Sabbath, for it is holy; he that polluteth it ſhall die the death:</hi> and in the Booke of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers we reade that one of the children of Iſrael being ſeene to gather ſtickes vpon the Sabbath day, hee was brought vnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> who not knowing what courſe to take therein, the Lord ſaid vnto <hi>Moſes; This man ſhall die the death, all the people ſhall ſtone him with ſtones, and he ſhall die.</hi> God would that his Sabbath ſhould be kept with ſuch reuerence, that the children of Iſrael durſt not to gather Manna therein, when it was giuen them from heauen.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond thing which we are to obſerue, is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue our ſelues from ſinne, as it is ſaid in Exodus, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to ſanctifie the day of reſt, that is, to obſerue it, by keeping thy ſelfe carefully from ſinne. And therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> It is better to labour and to dig the earth vpon the Lords day, then to bee drunke, or to commit any other ſinnes; for ſinne is a ſeruile worke, by which a man ſerues the deuill. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he ſaith that it is better to labour with profit, then to range and roame abroad idly: For the day of the Lord was not ordained to the end that a man ſhould ceaſe from worldly good workes, and giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto ſinne; but to the end he ſhould addict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſpirituall labours, which are better then the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:173840:196"/>worldly, and that hee repent himſelfe of thoſe ſinnes he hath committed, the whole Sabbath throughout: for idleneſſe is the Schoole-maſter of all euill. <hi>Seneca</hi> faith, It is a ſepulchre of a liuing man.</p>
                     <p>The fourth thing is to doe that which may be good and profitable to the ſoule; as to think on God, deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray vnto him, dilligently to heare his Word and Commandements, to giue thankes vnto God for all his benefits, to inſtruct the ignorant, to correct the erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, and to preſerue our ſelues from all ſinne, to the end that ſaying of <hi>Eſay</hi> might bee accompliſhed; <hi>Repent you of your ſinnes, and learne to doe good:</hi> for reſt is not good, if it bee not accompanied with good workes.</p>

                     <p>MVrder is eſpecially forbidden in this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but more generally, to hurt our Neighbour in any manner whatſoeuer, as with words, detractions, iniuries, or deeds, as to ſtrike our Neighbour. Of the firſt ſort it is ſaid, <hi>Mathew</hi> 5.22. <hi>Whoſoeuer is angry with his brother without a cauſe, ſhall be in danger of iudgement.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, Chapter 1.20. <hi>The wrath of man worketh not the righteouſneſſe of God.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Let not the Sunne goe downe vpon your anger.</hi> He that is angry with his brother without cauſe, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of iudgement; but not hee that is angry vpon iuſt occaſion. For if a man ſhould not be angry ſometimes, the doctrine were not profitable, neither would the iudgement bee diſcerned, nor ſinne puniſhed. And therefore iuſt anger is the Mother of diſcipline, and they that in ſuch a caſe are not angry, ſinne: for that patience that is without reaſon, is the ſeed of vices, it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:173840:198"/>nouriſheth negligence, it ſuffereth not onely the bad to ſwerue, but the good too: For when the euill is corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, it vaniſheth. So that it is plaine, that anger is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times good, when it is for the loue of righteouſneſſe, or when a man is angry with his owne ſinnes, or the ſinnes of another man. Thus was Chriſt angry with the Phariſes. The other ſort of anger is wicked, which proceedeth from a defire of reuenge, which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Vengeance belongs vnto me (ſaith the Lord) and I will reuenge.</p>

But to pray much, is to be feruent in prayer. And therefore to be long in prayer, is to preſent things neceſſary in ſuperfluous words. To pray much, is to ſolicit that we pray for with a ſeemely decency and affection of heart, which is better done by teares, then by words; becauſe God who ſeeth the ſecrets of our heart, is more moued with a deepe grone or ſigh, by plaints and teares that come from the heart, then by a thouſand words.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173840:202"/>But many there are in theſe dayes that reſemble the Pagans, to whom Chriſt would not haue his Diſciples to be like; for they thinke and beleeue that they ſhall bee the rather heard for their many words in their prayers: whereby it comes to paſſe, that they looſe much time vnder a pretence of prayer. <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides experience makes it good, that a man is neuer in the ſame eſtate in this life, but hee is now diſpoſed to doe one thing, and preſently to doe another. And therefore there is no man that can keepe his minde, his ſpirit, bent and attentiue to prayer, a whole day or a whole night together, except God giue the eſpeciall aſſiſtance of his grace. And if a man hath not his heart ſetled vpon that which he ſpeaketh, he looſeth his time, becauſe hee prayes in vaine, and his ſoule is troubled, and his minde wandring another way. And therefore God hath appointed to his ſeruants-other exerciſes, vertuous, ſpirituall, and corporall, wherein a man may ordinarily exerciſe himſelfe, ſometimes in one, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in another, either for themſelues, or their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, hauing their hearts lifted vp vnto God, with all their power, in ſuch ſort that they may not bee idle. And therefore that man that liues well, according to the will of God, and the Doctrine of his Saints, prayeth alwayes. For euery good worke is a good prayer vnto God. And as for thou that readeſt, know that all the prayers of the old and new Teſtament, doe agree with this; and that no prayer can be pleaſing vnto God, that hath not a reference ſome way or other vnto this. And therefore euery Chriſtian ought to apply himſelfe to vnderſtand and to learne this prayer, which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath taught with his owne mouth.</p>
                  <p>Now it is neceſſary that he that is heard of God, be
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:173840:203"/>agreeable vnto him, and know thoſe benefits hee hath receiued from him. For ingratitude is a winde that dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vp the Fountaine of the mercy and compaſſion of our God. And therefore if thou wilt pray, or aske any thing at Gods hand, thinke with thy ſelfe before thou aske, what and how great benefits thou haſt receiued from him, and if thou canſt not call them all to minde, yet at the leaſt forget not to beg that grace, that thou mayeſt be bold to call him Father. And thinke and know in how diuers a manner he is thy Father: for hee is the Father of all Creatures generally by creation, for he hath created them all. He is a Father by diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for he hath ordained them, and diſpoſed them all in his due place, as being very good. By preſeruation; for he hath preſerued all Creatures, that they faile not in their kinde, amongſt which his Creatures thou art one. And beſides, hee is the Father of mankind by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, for hee hath bought him with the precious blond of his Sonne, the Lambe without ſpot: By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, for he hath taught him by his Prophets, by his Sonne, and by his Apoſtles and Doctors, and that after a diuers manner, the way to returne into Paradice, from whence wee were driuen by the ſinne of our firſt Father <hi>Adam.</hi> By chaſtiſement, for he chaſtiſeth and correcteth vs in this life diuers wayes, to the end wee may returne vnto him, and not be condemned eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in another life.</p>

But accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order of diuine Iuſtice, the Kingdome of grace is before the Kingdome of glory. And therefore they that liue in the Kingdome of grace, by which we are to paſſe, if wee will enter the Kingdome of glory, without doubt they ſhall raigne in the Kingdome of glory; and no man can reigne there by any other meanes.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:173840:205"/>Moreouer we beſeech thee that thou wilt bee pleaſed, ſo to deale with vs, that wee may vſe this bread with ſobriety to thy glory, and the good both of body and ſoule. For the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.49. <hi>That fulneſſe of bread, and abundance of idleneſſe, was the cauſe of the iniquities and abominations of Sodom, which were ſo great in the ſight of God, that he ſent downe fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone to conſume them.</hi> Whereupon a certaine learned Father ſaith, that coſtly apparrell, ſuperfluitie in diet, play, idleneſſe and ſleepe, fatten the body, nouriſh luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, weaken the ſpirit, and leade the ſoule vnto death; but a ſpare diet, labour, ſhort ſleepe, poore garments, purifie the ſoule, tame the body, mortifie the luſts of the fleſh, and comfort the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>The ſpirituall Bread is the Word of God. Of this Bread the Prophet ſpeaketh; <hi>Thy bread quickeneth mee.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith in the Goſpell; <hi>Verily I ſay vnto you, that the houre commeth, when the dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare him ſhall liue.</hi> And this is found true by this experience: That is, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being dead in their ſinnes, hearing the Preaching of the Word of God, haue departed, quickned, &amp; raiſed, by the ſaid Word of God, &amp; betaken themſelues to true repentance which giueth life.

This bread delighteth the ſoule more then honey and the honey-combe. And therefore ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>Canticles</hi> 2.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:173840:205"/>Spirituall Bread, and that is the Body and Blood of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. In the Sacrament, they that receiue it worthily, receiue not onely grace, but Chriſt the Sonne of God ſpiritually, in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Sacrament, according to the ſaying of Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his Booke of the Citie of God, is an inuiſible grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by a viſible thing. Or a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a ſigne of a holy thing. There is great difference betwixt the bare Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and the cauſe of the Sacrament, euen as much as betweene ſigne and the thing ſignified. For the cauſe of the Sacrament is the Diuine grace, and the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:173840:207"/>merit of Ieſus Chriſt crucified, who is the rayſing of thoſe that were fallen. This cauſe of the Sacrament, is Powerfully, Eſſentially, and by authority in God, and in Ieſus Chriſt Meritoriouſly. For by the cruell Paſſion and effuſion of his Bloud, he hath obtained grace and righteouſneſſe vnto all the faithfull. But the thing it ſelfe of the Sacrament, is in the ſoule of the faithfull, by participation, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh; <hi>Wee haue beene made partakers of Chriſt.</hi> It is in the Word of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, by annunciation, or manifeſtation. In the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Sacramentally. For the Lord Ieſus hath lent, or giuen theſe helpes of the outward Sacraments, to the end the Miniſters, inſtructing in the faith, ſhould ſo accommodate themſelues to humane weakeneſſe, as that they might the better edifie the people by the Word of the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>There are two Sacraments: The one of water, the other of nouriſhment, that is to ſay, of Bread and Wine.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is called Baptiſme, that is to ſay in our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the waſhing with water, either of the riuer or the fountaine, and it muſt be adminiſtred, <hi>In the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt;</hi> to the end that firſt, by the meanes of the grace of God the Father, beholding his Sonne, and by the participation of Ieſus Chriſt, who hath bought vs, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the holy Ghoſt, which imprinteth a liuely faith in our hearts, the ſinnes of thoſe that are Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, are pardoned, and they receiued into grace, and afterwards hauing perſeuered therein, are ſaued in Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Baptiſme wherewith wee are Baptized, is the ſame wherewith it pleaſed our Sauiour himſelfe to bee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173840:207"/>Baptized, to accompliſh all righteouſneſſe, as it was his will to be Circumciſed, and wherewith hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles to be Baptized.</p>
                  <p>The things that are not neceſſary in Baptiſme, are the Exorciſmes, the breathings, the ſignes of the Croſſe vpon the Infant, either the breſt or the forehead, the ſalt put into the mouth, the ſpittle into the eares and noſtrills, the vnction of the breſt, the Monkes Cowle, the anoynting of the Chreſme vpon the head, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers the like things, conſecrated by the Biſhop, as alſo the putting of the Taper in his hands, clothing it with a white veſtment, the bleſſing of the water, the dipping of it thrice in the water: All theſe things vſed in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, are not neceſſary, they neither being of the ſubſtance, nor requiſite in the Sacrament of Baptiſme, from which things many take occaſion of errour and ſuperſtition, rather then edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to ſaluation.</p>
                  <p>Now this Baptiſme is viſible and materiall, which maketh the partie neither good nor euill, as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the Scripture, by <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> And whereas Baptiſme is adminiſtred in a full congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the faithfull, it is to the end that he that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the Church, ſhould be reputed and held of all for a Chriſtian brother, and that all the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might pray for him, that hee may be a Chriſtian in heart, as he is outwardly eſteemed to bee a Chriſtian. And for this cauſe it is that we preſent our children in Baptiſme; which they ought to doe, to whom the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are neereſt, as their parents, and they to whom God hath giuen this Charitie.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:173840:208"/>
                  <q>Of the Supper of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</q>
                  <p>AS Baptiſme which is taken viſibly, is as an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolement into the number of faithfull Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, which carrieth in it ſelfe proteſtation and promiſe to follow Chriſt Ieſus, and to keepe his holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to liue according to his holy Goſpell; So the holy Supper and Communion of our bleſſed Sauiour, the breaking of bread, and the giuing of thankes, is a viſible communion made with the members of Ieſus Chriſt. For they that take and breake one and the ſame bread, are one and the ſame body, that is to ſay, the Body of Ieſus Chriſt, and they are members one of another, ingrafted and planted in him, to whom they proteſt and promiſe to perſeuere in his ſeruice to their liues end, neuer departing from the faith of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the vnion which they haue all promiſed by Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore as all the members are nouriſhed with one and the ſame viands, and all the faithfull take one and the ſame Spirituall Bread, of the word of Life, the Goſpell of Saluation; So they all liue by one and the ſame Spirit, and one and the ſame Faith.</p>
                  <p>This Sacrament of the Communion of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, is called in Greeke, <hi>Euchariſtia,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Good Grace:</hi> of this doth S. <hi>Matth.</hi> teſtifie in his 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Ieſus tooke bread and bleſſed it, and brake it, and gaue it to his diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eate, this is my body.</hi> And S. <hi>Luke Chap.</hi> 22. <hi>This is my body which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for you, this doe in remembrance of me.

                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:173840:208"/>
                  <p>This Sacrament was inſtituted by diuine ordinance, perfectly to ſignifie vnto vs, the ſpirituall nouriſhment of man in God, by meanes whereof the ſpirituall life is preſerued, and without which it decayeth, the truth it ſelfe ſaying; <hi>If you eate not the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke not his bloud, there ſhall be no life in you.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Sacrament, wee muſt hold that which followeth, by the teſtimony of the Scriptures. That is, that wee muſt confeſſe ſimply and in purity of heart, that the bread which Chriſt tooke in his laſt Supper, which he bleſſed, brake, and gaue to eate to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, that in the taking thereof, by the miniſtry of his faithfull Paſtors, he hath left a remembrance of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which in it owne nature is true bred, and that by this Pronowne, <hi>This,</hi> is demonſtrated this ſacramentall propoſition. <hi>This is my Body,</hi> not vnderſtanding theſe words Identically, of a numerall Identity, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, really, and truly, but not meaſurably. The ſame body of Chriſt, ſitting in heauen at the right hand of his Father, vnto whom euery faithfull Receiuer muſt caſt vp the eyes of his vnderſtanding, hauing his heart eleuated on high, and ſo eate him ſpiritually, and ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally by an aſſured faith. The ſame we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand of the Sacrament of the Cup.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, that the eating and drinking of this Sacrament, muſt be vnderſtood ſpiritually.

Of the ſpirituall eating Chriſt ſaith; <hi>He that ſhall eate my fleſh, and drinke
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:173840:209"/>my bloud, is in me, and I in him.</hi> There is alſo a twofold manner of eating, the one ſacramentall, and ſo both good and bad doe eate; the other ſpirituall, and ſo the good onely doe eate. And therefore ſaith <hi>Auguſtine, What is it to eate Chriſt?</hi> It is not onely to receiue his body in the Sacrament, for many doe eate him vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, who will not dwell in him, nor haue him to dwell in them; but he eates him ſpiritually that continueth in the truth of Chriſt. And therefore to eate the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Bread, is to eate the Body of Chriſt in a figure. Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe ſaying, <hi>Neuertheleſſe, as oft as you doe this, you ſhall doe it in remembrance of me.</hi> For if this eating were not in figure, Chriſt ſhould be alwayes bound to ſuch a thing, for it is neceſſary that the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall eating ſhould be continuall: As Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh; <hi>He that eateth Chriſt in truth, is he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in him.</hi> For Chriſt ſaith, <hi>that to eate him, is to dwell in him:</hi> In the celebration of this Sacrament, Prayer is profitable, and the preaching of the Word in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue, ſuch as may edifie, and is agreeable to the Euangelicall Law, to the end, that peace and charity might encreaſe amongſt the people; but other things that are in vſe in theſe dayes in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and thoſe that are members thereof, belong not at all to the Sacrament.</p>

He muſt admoniſh them touching the great bounty and mercy of God, ſhewing that there can proceed nothing but what is good, from him that is the Fountaine of all goodneſſe, and that he that is Almighty, is our mercifull Father,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:173840:212"/>more carefull of vs, then euer Father or Mother hath beene of their Children; telling them, that though a Mother may forget her Childe, and the Nurſe him to whom ſhee hath giuen ſucke, and which ſhee hath bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in her wombe, yet notwithſtanding our heauenly Father will not forget vs, doing all things for our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and ſending all things for our greater good, and if it were more expedient for vs to enioy our health, wee ſhould haue it. And therefore wee are to ſubmit our wils to his will, and our liues to his conduct and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and aſſuredly beleeue that he loueth vs, and out of his loue, he chaſtiſeth vs. Neither muſt wee reſpect the griefe or pouerty we endure, nor thinke that God hateth vs, and caſteth vs off; but rather we muſt thinke, that we are the more in his grace and fauour, nothing regarding thoſe that flouriſh in this World, and haue here their conſolation, but looking vpon Chriſt Ieſus, more beloued of his Father then any other, who is the true Sonne of God, and yet hath beene more afflicted then we all, and more tormented then any other. For not onely that bitter paſſion that he ſuffered, was very hard and grieuous vnto him, but much more in regard that in the middeſt of his torments, euery one cryed out againſt him, like angry dogs, belching out againſt him many villanous ſpeeches, doing againſt him the worſt they could, in ſuch ſort, that hee was conſtrained to cry out in his torments, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> And finding the houre of his paſſion to draw neere, he grew heauy vnto the death, and prayed vnto his Father, that that Cup might paſſe from him, inſomuch that he did ſweat water and bloud, becauſe of that great heauineſſe and anguiſh of heart which he ſhould endure in this cruell death.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:173840:213"/>
                  <p>And therefore the ſicke man muſt conſider with himſelfe, that he is not ſo ill handled, nor ſo grieuouſly tormented, as his Sauiour was, when he ſuffered for vs, for which he is to yeeld thankes vnto God, that it hath pleaſed him to deliuer vs, and to giue this good Sauiour vnto the death for vs, begging mercy and fauour at his hands in the name of Ieſus. And it is neceſſary that we haue with all this perfect confidence and aſſurance, that our Father will forgiue vs for his goodneſſe ſake. For hee is full of mercy, ſlow to anger, and ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue.</p>
                  <p>And therefore the ſicke party muſt recommend, and commit himſelfe wholy vnto the mercy of his Lord, to doe with him as ſhall ſeeme good in his eyes, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe both of his body and ſoule, according to his good will and pleaſure. Alſo it ſhall be neceſſary to admoniſh the ſicke perſon, to doe vnto his Neighbour, as hee would haue his Neighbour doe vnto him, not wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any man, and to take ſuch order with all that are his, that hee may leaue them in peace, that there may not be any ſuites, or contentions amongſt them after his death.</p>
                  <p>He muſt alſo bee exhorted to hope for ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt, and not in any other, or by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, acknowledging himſelfe a miſerable ſinner, to the end hee may aske pardon of God, finding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be in ſuch a manner culpable, that he deſerueth of himſelfe eternall death. And if the ſicke party ſhall be ſtricken with a feare of the iudgement of God, and his anger againſt ſinne and ſinners; he muſt put him in minde of thoſe comfortable promiſes, which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath made vnto all thoſe that come vnto him, and from the bottome of their heart call vpon him, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:173840:213"/>how God the Father hath promiſed pardon, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wee ſhall aske it in the name of his Sonne, and our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus. Theſe are the things wherein the true Preacher of the Word ought faithfully to employ himſelfe, to conduct the party viſited to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour.</p>
                  <p>And when he is departed this life, he muſt giue heart and courage to the ſuruiuers, by godly exhortations, to the end they may be comforted to praiſe God, and to conforme themſelues to his holy will; and whereas in former times it hath beene the manner to cauſe the poore and deſolate widow to ſpend much ſiluer, hauing loſt her Husband, vpon ſingers, and ringers, and eaters, and drinkers, whileſt ſhee ſits weeping and faſting, wronging hereby her fatherleſſe Children; to the end that loſſe be not added to loſſe, it is our duty, taking pitty on them, to aide them with our councell and with our goods, according to that ability that God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on vs, taking care that the Children be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, to the end, that liuing like Chriſtians, according to the will of God, they may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to get their liuing, as God hath ordained and commanded.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as all receiue not theſe corrections in charity, our Lord teacheth our ſpirituall guides, what courſe they ſhould take, ſaying; <hi>If hee hearken not vnto thee, take with thee one or two, for in the mouth of two or three, ſhall euery one be iuſtified.</hi> Our Lords meaning is, if the fault be not publiſhed and knowne by diuers; but not ſo if the ſinne be manifeſt and made knowne to euery man: In ſuch a caſe, the chaſtiſement muſt be made manifeſt too. The Apoſtle telleth vs as much, in the firſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> 5.20. <hi>Them that ſinne, rebuke before all, that others alſo may feare.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Dance is the Diuels proceſſion, and he that entreth into a Dance, entreth into his poſſeſſion. The deuill is the guide, the middle, and the end of the Dance. As many paces as a man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in dancing, ſo many paces doth he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:173840:218"/>make to goe to hell. A man ſinneth in dancing diuers wayes; as in his pace, for all his ſteps are numbred; in his touch, in his ornaments, in his hearing, ſight, ſpeech, and other vanities. And therefore wee will prooue, firſt by the Scripture, and afterwards by diuers other reaſons, how wicked a thing it is to dance. The firſt teſtimony that we will produce, is that which wee reade in the Goſpell, <hi>Marke 6.</hi> It pleaſed <hi>Herod</hi> ſo well, that it coſt <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> his life. The ſecond is in <hi>Exodus</hi> 32. When <hi>Moſes</hi> comming neere to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, ſaw the Calfe, hee caſt the Tables from him, and brake them at the foote of the mountaine, and afterwards it coſt three and twenty thouſand their liues. Beſides the ornaments which women weare in their dances, are as crownes for many victories which the deuill hath gotten againſt the children of God. For the deuill hath not onely one ſword in the dance, but as many as there are beautifull and well adorned perſons in the dance. For the words of a woman are a glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſword. And therefore that place is much to bee feared, wherein the enemy hath ſo many ſwords, ſince that one onely ſword of his may bee feared. Againe, the deuill in this place, ſtrikes with a ſharpened ſword, for the women come not willingly to the dance, if they be not painted, and adorned, the which painting and ornament, is as a grindſtone, vpon which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſharpeneth his ſword. They that decke and adorne their daughters, are like thoſe that put dry wood to the fire, to the end it may burne the better: For ſuch wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men kindle the fire of luxury in the hearts of men; as <hi>Sampſons</hi> Foxes fired the Philiſtims corne, ſo theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, they haue fire in their faces, and in their geſtures and actions, their glances and wanton words by which
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:173840:218"/>they conſume the goods of men. Againe, the deuill in the dance vſeth the ſtrongeſt armour that hee hath, for his moſt powerfull armes are women, which is made plaine vnto vs, in that the deuill made choiſe of the woman to deceiue the firſt man; So did <hi>Balaam,</hi> that the children of Iſrael might be reiected. By a woman hee made <hi>Sampſon, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Abſolon</hi> to ſinne. The deuill tempteth men by women, three manner of wayes, that is to ſay, by the touch, by the eye, by the care: By theſe three meanes he tempteth fooliſh men to dancings, by touching their hands, beholding their beauty, hearing their ſongs and muſicke. Againe, they that dance, breake that promiſe and agreement which they haue made with God in Baptiſme, when their Godfathers promiſe for them, that they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the deuill, and all his pompe; For dancing is the pompe of the deuill, and hee that danceth maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his pompe, and ſingeth his Maſſe. For the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſingeth in the dance, is the Prioreſſe of the deuill, and thoſe that anſwere are the Clerkes, and the beholders are the Pariſhioners, and the muſicke are the Belles, and the Fidlers the miniſters of the Deuill. For as when Hogges are ſtrayed, if the Hog-heard call one, all aſſemble themſelues together; So the deuill cauſeth one woman to ſing in the dance, or to play on ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and preſently all the dancers gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Againe, in a dance a man breakes the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God. As firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt haue no other Gods but me, &amp;c.</hi> For in dancing a man ſerues that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whom hee moſt deſires to ſerue, and therefore ſaith Sant <hi>Ierom,</hi> Euery mans God is that hee ſerues and loues beſt. He ſinnes againſt the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, when hee makes an Idol of that hee loues.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:173840:219"/>Againſt the third, in that oathes are frequent amongſt dancers. Againſt the fourth, for by dancing the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both day is profaned. Againſt the fift, for in the dance, the parents are many times diſhonoured, when many bargaines are made without their counſell. Againſt the ſixt, A man killes in dancing, for euery one that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to pleaſe another, he killes the ſoule as oft as hee perſwadeth vnto luſt. Againſt the ſeuenth; For the partie that danceth, bee it male or female, committoth adultery, with the partie they luſt after. <hi>For hee that looketh on a woman and luſteth after her, hath already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery in his heart.</hi> Againſt the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement a man ſinnes in dancing, when hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth the heart of another from God. Againſt the ninth, when in dancing hee ſpeakes falſely againſt the truth. Againſt the tenth, when women affect the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others, and men couet the wiues, daughters, and ſeruants of their neighbours.</p>
                  <p>Againe, a man may prooue how great an euill dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is, by the multitude of ſinnes that accompany thoſe that dance; for they dance without meaſure or number: And therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> The miſerable dancer knowes not, that as many paces as he makes in dancing, ſo many leapes hee makes to hell. They ſinne in their ornaments after a fiue-fold maner. Firſt, by being proud thereof. Secondly, by inflaming the hearts of thoſe that behold them. Thirdly, when they make thoſe aſhamed that haue not the like orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, giuing them occaſion to couet the like. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by making women importunate, in demanding the like ornaments of their husbands. And fiftly, when they cannot obtaine them of their husbands, they ſeeke to get them elſewhere by ſinne. They ſinne by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:173840:219"/>ſinging, and playing on Inſtruments; for their ſongs bewitch the hearts of thoſe that heare them with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall delight, forgetting God, vttering nothing in their ſongs, but lyes and vanities. And the very motion of the body which is vſed in dancing, giues teſtimony enough of euill.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, that dancing is the deuils proceſſion, and he that entreth into a dance, enters into the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is not any ſpeciall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ordained, in any degree, or office, or miniſtery, but it is that falſehood it ſelfe, which oppoſeth it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the trueth, which couereth and adorneth it ſelfe with beauty and pietie, out of the Church of Chriſt, as with names and offices, and Scriptures, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and diuers other things. That iniquity that is after this manner, with all the Miniſters thereof, great and ſmall, with all thoſe that follow them with a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked heart, and hood-winked eyes; this congregation, I ſay, thus taken altogether, is called Antichriſt, or Babylon, or the fourth Beaſt, or the Whore, or the man of ſinne, or the ſonne of perdition.</p>
                  <p>The Miniſters are called, falſe prophets, lying tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, the Miniſters of darkeneſſe, the ſpirit of errour, the Apocalipticall whore, the mother of Fornication, cloudes without water, trees without leaues, dead and twice rooted vp, waues of a troubleſome ſea, wandring ſtarres, Balaamites, and Egyptians.</p>
                  <p>It is called Antichriſt, becauſe being couered and adorned vnder the colour of Chriſt, and of his Church, and the faithfull members thereof, it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth the ſaluation purchaſed by Chriſt, and truely adminiſtred in the Church of Chriſt, whereof the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are partakers, by Faith, Hope, and Charity. Thus it contradicteth the truth, by the wiſedome of the world, by falſe religion, by counterfeited holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by ſpirituall power, ſecular tyrannie, riches,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:173840:221"/>honours, dignities, and the delights and delicacies of the world.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch therefore as it is manifeſt to euery one, that Antichriſt cannot come in any forme or faſhion whatſoeuer, but ſo as that all theſe things, aboue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned muſt bee ioyned together to make a perfect hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie and falſehood, that is to ſay, with the wiſe of the world, the Religious, Phariſes, Miniſters, Doctors, with the ſecular power, with the people of the world ioyned all together, who then altogether make the man of ſinne and errour fully compleate. For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Antichriſt were long ſince conceiued, in the Apoſtles times, yet it was then in the infancie, and it wanted members both inward and outward.

For it had not the wiſedome, nor the reaſon to excuſe it ſelfe, to define and pronounce ſentence.

And in all theſe, to couer it ſelfe with the cloake of authority, and of the Word, deceiuing by this meanes the rude people, who follow the World, ſeparating themſelues from God, and the true Faith, and the reformation of the holy Spirit, from true repentance, and the powerfull opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſeuerance in good, forſaking charity, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, humility, and that which is worſt of all, departing from the true hope, and putting their truſt in the vaine confidence of the World, making themſelues ſeruants to ceremonies, which make for theſe things, fraudulent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſing the people to fall downe and to worſhip the Idols of the World, vnder the name of Saints and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, in ſuch ſort, that men wandring wickedly from the way of truth, thinke they ſerue God, and doe well,

                     <p>

                     <p>The firſt worke is, that hee turneth that ſeruice and worſhip which is onely proper and due vnto God, to himſelfe and his workes, and to the poore creature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and vnreaſonable, ſenſible and inſenſible. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as to men, hee-Saints and ſhee-Saints, that are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:173840:223"/>departed out of this world: Vnreaſonable, and to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, carrion or reliques. His workes are the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, eſpecially the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, which he adoreth as God, and as Ieſus Chriſt, ſeruing things bleſſed, and conſecrated, and forbidding the worſhip of the onely God.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond worke of Antichriſt is, that he robbeth Chriſt of his merit, with all the ſufficiency of grace, righteouſneſſe, regeneration, remiſſion of ſinnes, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, confirmation in grace and ſpirituall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; and imputeth and attributeth it to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to the forme of words, and to his workes, and to Saints, and to their interceſſion, and to the fire of Purgatory, drawing the people from Chriſt and his conduct vnto the things aboue-named, to the end men ſhould not ſeeke the things of Chriſt, nor by Chriſt, but truſt only to be ſaued by the works of their hands, and not by a liuely faith in God, and his Sonne Chriſt Ieſus, and his holy Spirit, but by the will and workes of Antichriſt, for ſo he teacheth that all ſaluation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in his workes.</p>
                     <p>The third worke of Antichriſt conſiſteth in this, that he attributeth the renewing by the holy Ghoſt to an outward dead faith, and baptizeth children into that faith, and that by it wee haue the Baptiſme and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and therein hee giueth Orders and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in it he groundeth all Chriſtianity, which is repugnant to the Spirit of God.</p>
                     <p>The fourth worke of Antichriſt is, that hee hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and placed all Religion and Sanctity of the people in the Maſſe, and hath patched together many ceremonies, whereof ſome are Iudaicall, ſome Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, ſome Antichriſtian. To the hearing whereof,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173840:224"/>leading the congregation and the people, hee depriues them of their ſpirituall and Sacramentall food, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth them from the true Religion, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, and withdrawes them from the workes of mercy by his Offertory, and by his Maſſe he ſetteth the people in a vaine hope.</p>
                     <p>The fift worke of Antichriſt is, that hee doeth all his workes, to the end hee may bee ſeene of men, that he may ſolace himſelfe in his vnſatiable auarice, that he may make gaine of all things, and doe nothing without Simony.</p>
                     <p>The ſixt worke of Antichriſt is, that hee giueth way to all open and apparant ſinnes, without any Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſentence, neither doth hee excommunicate the impenitent.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth worke of Antichriſt is, that hee neither ruleth nor defendeth his vnity by the Word and power of the Spirit of God, but by the ſecular power, and hee addeth vnto his ayde things ſpirituall.</p>
                     <p>The eight worke of Antichriſt is, that hee hateth and perſecuteth, and putteth to death the members of Chriſt. Theſe are in a manner the principall workes which he doth againſt the truth, for all of them can by no meanes bee written or numbred. Let it ſuffice for this preſent that wee haue noted the more generall, and ſhall likewiſe ſet downe by what workes this iniquity is couered.</p>

                        <item>Secondly, hee couereth his iniquity by length of time, and in that he is maintained by certaine Sages,

                        </item>
                        <item>Sixtly, he couereth his iniquity with certaine words of Chriſt, and the writings of ancient Fathers, and with Councels, which they doe ſo farre forth obſerue, as that they may no way hinder their wicked liues and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</item>
                        <item>Seuenthly, by the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> of Penance, by which they diſgorge and vomit vp all their errours.</item>
                        <item>Eightly, by corrections, and verball preachings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vice; for they ſay, and doe not.</item>
                        <item>Ninthly, they couer their iniquity, by the vertuous life of ſome, that liue diſſemblingly, others truly. For the Elect of God, who will and doe that which is good, are detained as in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and are as gold wherewith
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173840:225"/>Antichriſt couereth his vanity, not permitting them to ſerue the onely God, or to put their truſt in Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or to embrace the true Religion. Theſe things and diuers others, are as the mantell or cloake of Antichriſt, wherewith he couereth his lyes and malice, to the end he may not be reiected as a Pagan, and vnder which he proceedeth diſhoneſtly, and like a whore.</item>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:173840:226"/>be ſaued, by the ayde and aſſiſtance of our Lord wee ioyne our ſelues to the truth of Chriſt, and of his Spouſe, how little ſoeuer it be in the eye of the world, ſo farre foorth as our vnderſtanding ſhall direct vs. And therefore we haue determined with our ſelues, to make knowne to the world, what are the cauſes of our departure, and what our congregation is, to the end that if the Lord ſhall giue the knowledge of the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame truth, they that haue receiued it ſhould loue it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our ſelues: And that if peraduenture they be not ſufficiently illuminated, they may receiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and aſſiſtance by this meanes, and be watered by the dew of heauen. And if this grace bee giuen more abundantly, and in a higher meaſure to any other, wee deſire in all humility to bee better inſtructed by him, intreating our faults and defects may bee amended. Theſe things then that follow are the cauſes of our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
                     <p>Be it knowne to all in generall, and euery particular perſon, that the cauſe of our ſeparation, is for the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall verity of Faith, and the miniſteriall. The Eſſentiall verity of Faith, is the inward knowledge of one true God, and the vnity of Eſſence in three perſons, which knowledge fleſh and bloud hath not giuen. As alſo for the decent and conuenient ſeruice due to one onely God; for the loue thereof aboue all things; for ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and the honour thereof aboue all things, and aboue all names; for a liuely hope by Chriſt in God; for regeneration and inward renouation by faith, hope, and charity; for the merit of Ieſus Chriſt, with all ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of grace and righteouſneſſe; for the participation or communion with all the Elect; for remiſſion of ſinnes; for holy conuerſation; and for the faithfull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:173840:227"/>of all the Commandements in the faith of Chriſt; for true repentance; for perſeuerance vnto the end, and for life euerlaſting.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſteriall verities are theſe: The outward Congregation of Miniſters, with the people ſubiect in place, time, and truth, by the miniſtry of the truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned, directing, eſtabliſhing, and preſeruing the Church; the ſaid Miniſters by faith, and an integrity of life, ſhewing themſelues obedient, and giuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues couragiouſly to the practiſe and vſuall cariage of our Sauiour ouer the flocke.</p>
                     <p>The things which the Miniſters are bound to doe, for the ſeruice of the people, are theſe: The Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall Word; the Sacraments annexed to the Word, which certifie what the intention and vnderſtanding hath beene; confirme the hope in Chriſt, and in the faithfull the miniſteriall communion of all things, by the Eſſentiall verity. And if there be any other miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall things, they may all bee referred to the aboue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named. But of theſe ſingular verities, ſome are eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially neceſſary to the ſaluation of man, others condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally. They are contained in the twelue Articles of our Faith, and in diuers writings of the Apoſtles. For Antichriſt hath long ſince raigned in the Church by diuine permiſſion.</p>
                     <p>The errours and impurities of Antichriſt, are theſe; that is to ſay, diuers and innumerable Idolatries againſt the Commandements of God and of Chriſt, by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice giuen to the creature, and not to the Creator, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inuiſible, corporall and ſpirituall, vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or ſenſible, naturall, or made and framed by ſome art, and vnder the name of Chriſt; or hee-ſaints, or ſhee-ſaints, or reliques, which creature is ſerued by faith, by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:173840:227"/>hope, by geſtures, by prayers, by pilgrimages, by almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds, by offerings and ſacrifices of great charge. The which creature they ſerue, adore, honor after a diuers manner, with ſongs, orations, ſolemnities, and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Maſſes, veſpers, complines, to the ſelfe-ſame creatures, with prayer bookes for certaine houres, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils, feaſts, purchaſing of grace, which is eſſentially in one onely God, and in Ieſus Chriſt meritoriouſly, and is obtained by faith onely, and by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>For there is no other cauſe of Idolatry, then the falſe opinion of grace, of truth, of authority, inuocation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion, which this Antichriſt hath taken from God, and attributed it to his ceremonies, authorities, the workes of his hands, and to Saints, and to Purgatory. And this iniquity of Antichriſt, is directly againſt the firſt Article of our Faith, and the firſt Commandement of the Law.</p>
                     <p>In like ſort, the diſorderly loue of the World, which is in Antichriſt, is that from whence doe ſpring all the ſinnes and wickedneſſe that is in the Church, in thoſe that are the Leaders, and Rulers, and Officers thereof, who ſinne without controlement againſt the truth of faith, and the knowledge of God the Father; witneſſe Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> who ſaith; <hi>He that ſinneth, knoweth not God: for if any man loue the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.</hi> The ſecond iniquity of Antichriſt conſiſts in the hope which he giueth of pardon, grace, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, truth, and eternall life; as not being in Chriſt, or in God by Chriſt, but in men liuing and dead, in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, eccleſiaſticall ceremonies, in benedictions, ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, prayers, and other things aboue mentioned; not by true faith, which brings forth repentance by charity, and a departure from euill, and cleauing to that which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:173840:228"/>is good. Now Antichriſt teacheth vs not to place our hope and confidence in ſuch things, that is to ſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, ſpirituall confirmation, or communion, the remiſſion of ſinnes, ſanctification, eternall life; but to hope in his Sacraments, and his wicked Simony, by which the people are abuſed in ſuch ſort, that they make ſale of all things, and inuent many ordinances old and new, to bring ſiluer into their cheſts, promiſing that if any man doe this or that, hee ſhall obtaine grace and life. And this double iniquity is called in Scriptures, adultery and fornication. And therefore ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as leade the brutiſh people into theſe errours, are called the Apocalipticall Whore. And this iniquity is againſt the ſecond Article, and the ſecond and third Commandement.</p>
                     <p>The third iniquity of Antichriſt conſiſteth in this, that he hath inuented (beſides thoſe aboue-named) other falſe religions and orders, and Monaſteries, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hope to obtaine grace, by building oratories for Saints; as alſo by deuout and frequent hearing of the Maſſe, by the receiuing the Sacrament, by Confeſſion, (though ſeldome with a contrite heart) by ſatisfaction, by faſtings, and emptying the purſe, by profeſſing himſelfe a member of the Church of Rome, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vowes, and giuing themſelues to orders of Capou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Cowles, which againſt all truth they affirme that men are bound vnto. And this iniquity of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is directly againſt the eight Article of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, <hi>I beleeve in the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth iniquity of Antichriſt conſiſteth in this, that notwithſtanding hee bee the fourth Beaſt deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the Apocalipticall whore, hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe adorneth himſelfe, with authority, power,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:173840:228"/>dignity, offices, Scriptures, and compareth himſelfe, and maketh himſelfe equall to the true and holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, in which there is ſaluation Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and not elſewhere, in which there is the truth of life and Doctrine, and of the Sacraments. For if he ſhould not thus couer himſelfe and his wicked Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, being knowne for manifeſt ſinners, hee would ſoone be forſaken and abandoned of euery one. For Emperours, and Kings, and Princes, thinking him to be like to the true and holy mother the Church, they haue loued and endowed him, contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God. And this iniquity of Miniſters, and ſubiects, and ſuch as are brought vp in errour and ſinne, is directly againſt the ninth Article: <hi>I beleeue in the holy Catholike Church.</hi> And thus much touching the firſt part.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as they that are partakers of the onely outward ceremonies ordained by the inuention of men, doe beleeue and hope, truely to performe their Paſtorall duties and cures, prouided onely that they be ſhauen, like ſheepe, and anoynted like walles, and bleſſed by touching the Booke, and the cup, with their hands, and ſo publiſh themſelues to haue taken the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſthood as they ſhould: So likewiſe (as it hath beene ſayd before) the people that are ſubiect vnto them doe communicate by words, by ſignes, by outward exerciſes, and by their diuers geſtures and actions thinke they participate of the truth it ſelfe, drawne from thence. And this is againſt the other part of the ninth Article: <hi>I beleeue the Communion of Saints.</hi> It ſtandeth vs therefore vpon to depart from the moſt wicked Communion of Monkes, whereunto carnall men are drawne, cauſing them for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:173840:229"/>couetouſneſſe to put their truſt in things of naught, yea though they bee luxurious and couetous, onely to the end men ſhould giue them, and then they tell them that they participate of their pouerty and of their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie.</p>
                     <p>The fift iniquity of Antichriſt conſiſts in this, that he ſayneth and promiſeth remiſſion of ſinnes, to ſuch offenders, as haue no true ſorrow and contrition for their ſinnes, and ceaſe not to perſeuere in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and that in the firſt place, hee promiſeth remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſinnes, becauſe of their auricular confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and humane abſolution in their Pilgrimages, and all for money. And this iniquity is againſt the eleuenth Article of our faith: <hi>I beleeue the forgiueſſe of ſinnes.</hi> For that is in God by authority, in Chriſt by miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Faith, Hope, Charity, Repentance, Obedience to the Word; and in man by participation.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth iniquity is, that they hope euen to their liues end, in the aboue-mentioned iniquities, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in extreame Vnction and deuiſed Purgatory, in ſuch ſort that the ignorant and rude people perſeuere in their errour, by giuing them to vnderſtand, that they are abſolued from their ſinnes, though they neuer depart from them of their owne free wills, but hope thereby to haue forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, and life euerlaſting. And this iniquity is directly againſt the eleuenth and twelfth Article of our Faith.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Of inuented Purgatory.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Purgatory which diuers Prieſts and Monkes ſeeke to aduance and teach as an Article of our Faith, with many lies and fables, is this. They affirme that after this life, and after the Aſcenſion of Chriſt into heauen, the ſoules eſpecially of thoſe that ſhall bee ſaued, not hauing ſatisfied in this life for their ſinnes, endure ſenſible paines, and are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in Purgatory after this life, and that after they are purged, they come out of Purgatory, ſome ſooner, and ſome later, and ſome not vntill the Day of Iudgement; which ſoules, all the faithfull may and ought to helpe after they are departed this life by the band of charity, by Prayers, Faſtings, Almes-deeds, and Maſſes. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which Purgatory, to ſatiate their auarice, many haue inuented diuers vncertaine things, which they haue taught and preached, ſaying, that ſuch ſoules are tormented in the ſaid Purgatory, ſome to the necke, ſome to the middle; and they ſay that ſometimes, they ſit and eate at table, and make bankets, eſpecially at the Feaſt of all Soules, when the people are offering liberally vpon their Sepulchres. And they ſay that ſometimes they gather the crummes vnder the rich mens tables. By this meanes, and diuers other the like dreames, auarice and Simony is increaſed and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, their Cloyſters aduanced, their ſumptuous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are built and inlarged, their Altars multiplyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173840:230"/>meaſure, and infinite numbers of Monkes and Canons, haue inuented diuers other things touching the deliuerance, and vnbinding the ſaid ſoules, bringing thereby the Word of God into contempt. Thus the people are ſtrangely mocked and deceiued touching their ſoules, as alſo in their ſubſtance, inaſmuch as they are made to put their truſt in things vncertaine, whileſt in the meane time the faithfull hide themſelues, for when they refuſe to preach and teach the ſaid Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as an Article of their faith, they are cruelly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death and Martired.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore fitting we ſhould ſpeake of this Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, and plainely giue the world to vnderſtand what we thinke thereof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore we ſay, that the ſoules of thoſe that are to be ſaued, muſt in the end bee purged from all their pollution, according to the Ordinance of God, as it appeareth in the 21. of the <hi>Reuelation: There ſhall in no wiſe enter into heauen any thing that defileth, neither whatſoeuer worketh abomination, or maketh a lye.</hi> Now we know that the Scriptures haue ſet downe many and diuers meanes to purge thoſe that are in this preſent life, of all their ſinnes. But Saint <hi>Peter</hi> telleth vs in the 15. of the <hi>Acts</hi> 9. that faith purifieth the heart, and that faith is ſufficient to purge away the euill, without any outward helpe; as appeareth by the thiefe at the right hand of Chriſt, who beleeuing and confeſſing his ſinnes was made worthy of Paradiſe. The other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of purging the Spouſe of Chriſt by repentance, is touched in <hi>Eſay, Chap.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Waſh yee, and make you cleane, put away the euill of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to doe euill.</hi> And preſently after: <hi>Though your ſinnes be as skarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow, though
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:173840:230"/>they be red like crimſon, they ſhall be as wooll.</hi> In which words the Lord offereth himſelfe to all that doe truely repent, according to the manner aboue-mentioned, and they that haue beene ſinfull ſhall be made as white as ſnow. There is likewiſe mention made of another kinde of purging of ſinne, in the third of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>He hath his fanne in his hand, and hee will thorowly purge his floore, and gather his wheate into the garner.</hi> The which words <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> expounds of the floore of the Church and the fire of tribulation. And not onely doth the Lord purge by tribulations, but he likewiſe purifieth his Spouſe heere in this life by himſelfe; as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Chriſt hath loued his Church and giuen himſelfe for it; That hee might ſanctifie and cleanſe it, with the waſhing of water by the Word, that hee might preſent it to himſelfe a glorious Church, not hauing ſpot or wrinckle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould bee holy and without blemiſh.</hi> Where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſheweth that Chriſt hath ſo loued his Church, that hee would not cleanſe it by any other waſhing, but his owne Blood, and that not ſo as that it ſhould not bee ſufficient but in ſuch a maner, as that there ſhould not remaine therein any vncleanneſſe, but that it ſhould bee a glorious Church, in ſuch ſort that there ſhould bee therein neither ſpot nor wrinckle, nor any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould bee holy and vndefiled. And this teſtimony of waſhing the Spouſe of Chriſt in his Blood, is not onely currant heere vpon earth, but in heauen too, by thoſe that haue obtained the actuall waſhing, of whom it is ſaid in the <hi>Reuelation, Chap.</hi> 7. <hi>Theſe are they which came out of great tribulation, and haue waſhed their robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lambe; Therefore are they before the Throne of God, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:173840:231"/>ſerue him day and night.</hi> Thus you ſee how many pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings may be gathered out of the Scriptures, to prooue that they that trauell in this life, are heere purged of their ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, we thinke it a great deale the ſurer way, that euery man doe ſo liue in this preſent world, that hee may haue no need afterwards of any purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For it is a great deale better to doe good in this preſent life, then afterwards to hope for an vncertaine helpe. And it is a ſurer courſe, that what good a man hopes ſhall be done vnto him by others after his death, he doe it himſelfe whilſt he liueth, being a more happy thing to depart a free-man, then to ſeeke his liberty, after he is bound.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer beſides that which hath beene hitherto ſpoken, we ſay that there is no place in Scripture to be found, nor amongſt the Doctours grounded vpon the Scriptures, that doth make good vnto vs that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are any way bound by any neceſſity to beleeue, or publikely to confeſſe, as an Article of their faith, that there is any ſuch place as Purgatory after this life, wherein after the aſcenſion of Chriſt into Heauen, the ſoules, eſpecially of thoſe that ſhall be ſaued, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſatisfied in this life for their ſinnes, endure ſenſible paines when they are departed of their bodies, and thereby are purged: of which ſoules ſome depart out of Purgatory ſooner, ſome later then others, and ſome a little before others at the day of Iudgement. And firſt as touching the Scriptures, no man can prooue it by them. For it is manifeſt, that if a man ſhall reade the whole Law, he ſhall neuer finde therein, any one place of Scripture that bindeth a Chriſtian neceſſarily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue as an Article of his faith, that there is after this
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:173840:231"/>life, any place called Purgatory, as ſome doe affirme. And there is no place in the whole Volume of the Booke of God which doth ſo much as name it, neither was there euer any ſoule found that hath entred the ſame Purgatory and came out againe.</p>
                  <p>There is no man bound therefore to beleeue it, or to hold it to be an Article of our faith. For confirmation heereof Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Booke, intituled, <hi>A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand words,</hi> writes thus: We beleeue according to the Catholike faith, and diuine authority, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen is the firſt place wherein Baptiſme is receiued; The ſecond is that wherein ſuch as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates and ſtrangers to the Faith of Chriſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure euerlaſting torments: As for a third place, we are altogether ignorant of any, neither doe wee finde it in the Scriptures. The ſame Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the ſame place, vpon theſe words, <hi>They ſhall not inherite the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> writeth thus. O my brethren, let no man deceiue himſelfe, for there are onely two places and a third is not to be found; For hee that deſerueth not to reigne with Chriſt, ſhall without all doubt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh with the deuill. And to this purpoſe, Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> writing vpon thoſe words in the 12. by Saint <hi>Matthew; The Kingdome of heauen is like vnto a man that is an houſholder,</hi> ſaith thus: The man that is the father of the family, is Chriſt, vnto whom heauen and earth are as a houſe; but his families are celeſtiall and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall, for whom he buildeth a houſe with three Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, that is, hell, heauen, and earth. The Combatants are they that dwell vpon the earth, the vanquiſhed in hell, and the Conquerours in heauen. Let vs, ſaith hee, that are in the middle roome, take heed, wee deſcend not to thoſe that are in hell, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:173840:232"/>mount vpward to thoſe that are in heauen.</p>
                  <p>By theſe authorities you may plainely ſee, that there are onely two certaine places, after the aſcenſion of Chriſt into heauen, into which the ſoules departed out of their bodies doe goe, and that there is no third place, neither can it be found in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>And therefore, foraſmuch as in the whole Law of God, there is no expreſſe mention of any ſuch place as Purgatory is, and the Apoſtles haue giuen vs no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions touching the ſame; and the Primatiue Church, gouerned by the Apoſtles, according to the Goſpell, haue left vs no Ordinances or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; but that Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> fiue hundred fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie eight yeeres after Chriſt, did ordayne (as wee may reade) that the dead ſhould bee remembred in the Maſſe, it followeth, that ſince there is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe proofe thereof in the Law of God, there is no neceſſity to beleeue the ſayd Purgatory, as an Article of our faith, or that there is any ſuch place after this life.</p>
                  <p>But heere is matter of doubt, becauſe men in theſe dayes, are ſtrangely affected to the helpe and ayde of the dead, notwithſtanding that in all the Scripture there be nothing expreſly taught, except in the Booke of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> which is no part of the Old Teſtament, nor Canonicall. And that neither Chriſt nor the Prophets, nor the Apoſtles, nor the Saints neere their time, haue euer taught to pray for the dead, but haue rather carefully taught that the people that liue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameably ſhall bee Saints. And therefore anſwering to the doubt aboue-mentioned, wee ſay that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe of this doting affection, proceedeth from the deceit, and trumperies, and auarice of the Prieſts,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:173840:232"/>who haue not taught the people as the Prophets of Chriſt, nor as his Apoſtles, to liue well, but to offer much, and to place their hope of deliuerance, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, in Purgatory.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of the Inuocation of Saints.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee are now to ſpeake of prayer vnto Saints, which certaine great Maſters, with their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers preach vnto the people, extolling and publiſhing it with great diligence, as an Article of their Faith; affirming that the Saints that are in their celeſtiall Countrey, are to be prayed vnto by vs, in the ſelfe ſame manner, as the Prieſts were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to doe, and other of the people by their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, enioyning them many other things, as helpes to their Inuocation. By which Inuocation, authorization, and magnification, the people carnally &amp; erroneouſly beleeue it; Imagining that as it is the manner and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice before earthly Kings when they are angry, that ſuch as are not in choller ſhould intercede for them, and pacifie their anger: ſo the people thinke it is ſo with God; that is, that the Saints doe appeaſe the wrath of God, when he is angry with ſinners.</p>
                  <p>But wee are not to beleeue any ſuch thing; for if it were ſo, there could be no true conformity betweene the will of the Saints, and the will of God: for it ſhould ſeeme that the Saints are not angry with thoſe, againſt whom God is moued to anger. Secondly, by this mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification and inuocation of Saints, the people fall into
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:173840:233"/>Idolatry, putting their truſt more in Saints then in God, and ſeruing them with greater affection then the onely God; which they ſhew by the effects, by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of their Altars, which are moſt precious, by their excellent Muſicke, the multiplication of their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and by other ſolemnities. By which meanes the ſimple people are induced to thinke, that the Saints are more mercifull then God, becauſe they free him from damnation, by thoſe prayers they make vnto God, whom God had condemned. Beſide this, to maintaine theſe things, the ſimple people are taught, that the Saints deſire that men ſhould offer oblations vnto them, and take pleaſure in their praiſes, and that they mediate principally for thoſe that offer incenſe vnto them, and other honours; all which things wee are to abhorre, and carefully to flie.</p>
                  <p>Of this Inuoucation therefore we are now to ſpeake, and to make knowne what our opinion is touching this prayer vnto Saints. And firſt let vs ſee what Inuocation is. Inuocation is a deſire of the whole vnderſtanding, and ſoule, ſent vnto God by the voyce, and by prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we know and beleeue that the man Chriſt Ieſus, is Mediator betweene God and man, and Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to God the Father, who hath payed for our ſinnes, that come vnto God by him, ſeeing hee euer liueth to make interceſſion for them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>No man comes to the Father but by him. And whatſoeuer yee ſhall aske in my name, that will I doe,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.13. <hi>Who giueth to all abundantly, and reproacheth no man; Iam.</hi> 1, He is our Aduocate to God the Father, and hee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our ſinnes. He offereth himſelfe vnto vs by all meanes, before we offer our ſelues vnto him. He is at the doore, and he knockes, that we may open vnto him,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:173840:233"/>he ſhutteth out all Idolatry, being at the right hand of his Father in Heauen, and his will is, that all the faithful haue him in their mindes, and looke onely vnto him; for all the care of the faithfull muſt tend vnto Chriſt by thought and affection, and muſt imitate him that is aboue. According to that which is ſaid; <hi>If you be riſen againe with Chriſt, ſeeke the things that are aboue, where Chriſt is ſitting at the right hand of God.</hi> He is the doore, by which whoſoeuer ſhall enter, ſhall be ſaued. <hi>No man commeth to the Father, but by me,</hi> ſaith he.</p>
                  <p>We beleeue in the third place, that the Saints are not propoſed vnto vs to worſhip, but to imitate. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>Be ye followers of me, as I am of Chriſt.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would not ſuffer himſelfe to be worſhipped by <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> nor the Angell by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt. And therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Booke of true Religion. <hi>O ye Religious,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>giue not your ſelues to the ſeruice of the dead; for if they haue liued holily, they are not ſuch as ſeeke for honours, or deſire to be ſerued by vs, but by him, by whom they are illuminated, they reioyce that we are their companions.</hi> And therefore they muſt be honoured by imitation, and not adored by Religion. All theſe things duly conſidered, wee ſay, that there is not any man borne of other body then Chriſt, which may be adored, or can be the true Aduocate and Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Men, or Interceſſor for ſinners with God the Father, but he alone; neither is it neceſſary that they ſhould be inuocated by the prayers and interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the liuing. It is hee that by ſpeciall priuiledge obtaines whatſoeuer he demands for mankinde, whom hee hath reconciled by his death. Hee is the one and onely Mediator betwixt God and man, the Aduocate, and Interceſſor to God the Father for ſinners, and in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:173840:234"/>ſuch ſort ſufficient, that the Father denyeth not any man what he demandeth in his name, but for the loue of him, he heareth thoſe that pray vnto him, or demand any thing at his hands by him. For being neere vnto God, liuing by himſelfe, he prayeth alwayes for vs. For it was neceſſary that we ſhould haue ſuch a ſoueraigne Sacrificer, as was holy, innocent, without blemiſh, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from ſinners, and exalted aboue the Heauens, the firſt Sonne begotten of his Father, which onely sonne being aboue all men, hath power and authority to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the other, to pray and to mediate for them. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> writeth concerning Chriſt in his 64 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ſaying; <hi>Thou art the Sacrificer, thou art the Sacrifice, thou art he that offereth, and thou art the offering.</hi> Ieſus is not entred into places made with hands, which were figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red correſpondent to the true, but hee is entred into Heauen it ſelfe, euen now to appeare for vs before the face of God.</p>
                  <p>Of him it is that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>We haue an Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with the Father, euen Ieſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.</note> 
                     <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt who dyed for vs, is alſo riſen againe, and ſitteth at the right hand of God, making interceſsion for vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore hee is but a foole that will deſire any other Interceſſor. For Chriſt is alwayes liuing, and prayeth to God the Father for vs, and is alwayes ready to ſuccour thoſe he loueth. And therefore if we keepe our ſelues to that he hath ſaid, we neede not deſire any other Saint to be our Mediator, becauſe he is more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and more ready to helpe, then any other can be. Adde hereunto that the minde of him that prayeth wandereth, and is confounded with the multitude of Saints to whom he prayes, when the affection is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:173840:234"/>from Chriſt, and therefore is much weakened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diuided amongſt many. Howſoeuer, many there are that thinke that when the prayer is directed to one onely, a man hath that only one for a Mediator, wheras more giue more ſpirituall helpe. But the Church would increaſe a great deale more, if it knew not this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of interceſſions now inuented. And therefore it is a great folly to forſake the Fountaine of liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to goe to troubled waters, and ſuch as are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre of. This then doth plainly appeare, that a man cannot obtaine any thing of God, but by the Mediator Chriſt Ieſus. In the ſecond place it ſhall be more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to worſhip Chriſt among thoſe that are ſimply men; for hee is a good and benigne Mediator, euen in the higheſt degree, both in the one and the other extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. Thirdly, if we keepe our ſelues vnto his Word, we neede not addreſſe our ſelues to other Saints for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedlers, ſince that he is more ready to helpe vs, then other Saints, being ordained of God for this purpoſe; that is, to the end that the interceſſion might be made by him, that is more mercifull then all others; for hee knowes for whom there is reaſon he ſhould pray: for hee hath ſhed his bloud for them, which hee will neuer forget, hauing grauen them in the palmes of his hands. Fourthly, in the primitiue Church, their prayers for ſpirituall aide, were made onely to Chriſt as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. Fiftly, then did the Church profit and encreaſe a great deale more then now it doth in theſe times, wherein men haue found many interceſſions, which are as ſo many clouds without water, darkening Chriſt the Sonne of Righteouſneſſe, who is the true Interceſſor. For many expecting ſpirituall comforts, are forſaken in their vaine hopes. For though ſo it be that God is iuſt,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:173840:235"/>and we vniuſt, and inſufficient of our ſelues, yet it is he that pardoneth our ſinnes, both paſſed and preſent. For hee gaue himſelfe for our redemption, that is to ſay, he hath been the Sacrifice by which our pardon hath been obtained: God hath ſent his Sonne, to the end he might pardon our ſinnes, hee is the remedy againſt ſinne, to the end we ſhould not fall into deſpaire. We muſt haue recourſe to Chriſt our Aduocate, who continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth our cauſe, beſeeching his Father for vs, whom wee haue not onely for an Aduocate, but for a Iudge too. For the Father hath giuen all iudgement to the Sonne, and conſequently, all penitent ſinners haue great reaſon to hope that hee that is our Iudge, is our Aduocate. This faith is grounded vpon Chriſt, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſtrong Rocke, vpon which all the Saints of God haue reſted themſelues, vntill the man of ſinne had power to bring in new interceſſions of Saints; which faith all the Saints haue profeſſed liuing here, and vnto this day doe confeſſe, that they are not ſaued by obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the interceſſion of any other God, but by him they haue obtained Heauen; of whom it is ſaid in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> Chap. 5.9. <hi>Thou art worthy to take the Booke, and to open the ſeales thereof; for thou waſt ſlaine, and haſt redeemed vs to God by thy bloud, out of euery kindred, and tongue, and people, and Nation; and haſt made vs vnto our God Kings and Prieſts.</hi> You ſee how their humility and thankfulneſſe doth ſtill reſound vpon the Earth, when they acknowledge that they are entred into that place wherein they are, by his bloud, and confeſſe that they haue receiued all their good by him, and whatſoeuer they enioy ſo long as they remaine in this life; that they receiue no good thing, but by their good Mediator and Interceſſor Chriſt Ieſus.</p>

                     <p>THe eating of the Sacramentall Bread, is the eating of the Body of Chriſt in a figure, Chriſt himſelfe hauing ſaid, <hi>As oft as yee ſhall doe this, doe it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of mee:</hi> for if this were not to eate in a figure, Chriſt ſhould be bound to bee eaten continually; for
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:173840:236"/>this ſpirituall eating is almoſt alwayes neceſſary; as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh, Hee eateth Chriſt in truth, that beleeueth in him. And Chriſt ſaith, that the eating is to dwell in him. In the celebration of this Sacrament, theſe things are profitable; Prayer, Loue, the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word in the vulgar tongue, and other things whatſoeuer they bee, that are ordained to this purpoſe, according to the Euangelicall Law, to the end that loue and charity may grow and increaſe amongſt the people. But other things beſides the conſecration of the Euchariſt, as thoſe that the Prieſts vſe in the Maſſe, or that the Clerke ſings to the Queere, from the beginning to the end, and the ornaments which the Prieſts vſe at this preſent in the Church of Rome, they belong of neceſſity to the Sacrament of the Supper of the Lord.</p>

                     <p>PRayer and faſting are profitable, when there is any queſtion of the celebration of Matrimony, and the inſtructions and aduertiſements touching the ſame. But the impoſition of hands, and thoſe Ligatures made with the Stole, and other things that are commonly obſerued therein, by humane cuſtome, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Word of God, are not of the ſubſtance, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required in marriage.</p>

But we haue nothing in the Scriptures that makes good any ſuch Orders, but onely the cuſtome of the Church. And the letters teſtimoniall, the anoynting of the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173840:236"/>hands, the donation of the ſeniture and violl into his hands, and other things commonly obſerued heerein, without the expreſſe Word, are not of the ſubſtance thereof, nor neceſſarily required in the taking of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>

                     <p>VVEe are now to ſpeake of the Cryſome, which at this preſent is called a Sacrament, hauing no ground for it in the Scriptures; Firſt that it ſhould be conſecrated by a Biſhop, and made with Oyle of Oliues, and Balſome, applyed to the forehead of the man baptized in the figure of the Croſſe, and with theſe words: <hi>I ſigne thee with the ſigne of the Croſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme thee by the ſigne of ſaluation, In the Name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt;</hi> which is done with impoſition of hands, and with white veſtments bound to the head: This is that which they call the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confirmation, which was neuer ordained by Chriſt or his Apoſtles. For Chriſt the patterne and preſident of the whole Church, was not confirmed in his owne perſon, neither did he require at his Baptiſme a Cryſome, but the water onely. And therefore this Sacrament cannot be neceſſary to ſaluation, whereby a man blaſphemeth the Name of God, and is brought in by the motion of the deuill, to the end the people might bee deceiued, and depriued of the faith of the Church, and that he might the rather put his truſt and confidence in theſe ſolemnities.</p>

                     <p>THere is a two-fold Faſt, Spirituall and Corporall. The Spirituall is to abſtaine from ſinne; The Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall from meates and drinkes.

                     <p>Note alſo that there are certaine Faſts, which are not to bee obſerued, or commended by the faithfull, but rather to bee abhorred; as the Faſts of the Scribes and Phariſes, which are ordained by Antichriſt, and ſmell of Idolatry: The Faſts of Heretikes, and ſuperſtitious perſons, which are obſerued by Enchanters, Sorcerers, Negromancers; and the Faſts dedicated to creatures, not to the Creator, which are not grounded vpon the Law of God: Diſorderly Faſts, obſerued with delicate viands of higheſt price, as fiſh, figges, rayſons, almonds,
